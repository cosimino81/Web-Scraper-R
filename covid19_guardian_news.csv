","Since first being recorded late last year in China, the Covid-19 coronavirus has spread around the world, and been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. By early spring, Europe had become the worst-affected region, with Italy and Spain particularly hard hit. However, differences in testing mean that the number of cases may be understated for some countries.The number of deaths is a more dependable indicator. The disease is hitting Italy and Spain with particular cruelty. But the trajectory in many countries is the same; the UK and US are a couple of weeks behind Italy in the progress of the epidemic.Meanwhile in Asia, where the disease began, the spread continues, although in China it seems for now to have passed its peak.In Europe most countries have closed schools, and many are in lockdown.Finally, a reminder that most people who contract the disease recover; many may never notice they had it at all.Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

But as the coronavirus lockdown wears on, we’re having to spend more time than ever cooped up in them. While all those useful places we once went to escape – the pubs, cafes, gyms and even friends’ homes – are out of bounds.Social distancing isn’t a problem for me; I’ve been practising it for years. If I could avoid my own shadow I would. However, for the less introverted and most of you who don’t reserve passing glances with long-time housemates solely for special occasions (such as when you have no choice), navigating this period might be quite difficult.For those sharing with friends, staying in might be slightly more bearable. But as the weeks wear on, it would be natural for tempers to fray even among the tightest groups. Those living with strangers may find it more awkward – although it could also be an opportunity to make a shared space more of a home. So how can you make sure you come out of this period with friendships intact, or deeper bonds formed? Here are some tips for successful lockdown living.The pandemic is affecting people in many different ways. Some manage to keep a level head, follow the official advice and make the best of it. Others find their worries spiralling, spending their time glued to 24-hour news feeds and weighing up every cough and hot flush with frantic Googling.If you have a housemate who is suffering with anxiety it may feel natural to rush to reassure them or dismiss their fears. But, says Dr Warren Mansell, a reader in clinical psychology at the University of Manchester, you should try to avoid this. “Ask them what they are really concerned about, and what they are worried might happen. Even then, you don’t need to provide reassurance, because often when people express their worries out loud, they question it themselves. So, just help them explore what they are worried about and what they want right now.”Mess is always a problem in house shares, even at the best of times. At one end, there’s the housemate who is prone to leaving passive-aggressive notes for those who aren’t following their high standards. Then there’s the housemate whose bedroom smells vaguely like cheese. But there are things you can do to avoid conflict when avoiding your housemate is impossible. “You can help these people who are overly concerned by showing that you are following the recommendations of washing your hands at appropriate times,” says Dr Anisha Patel-Dunn, a psychiatrist and chief medical officer at the US healthcare company LifeStance Health. “Putting a sign in the kitchen and bathroom showing what the recommendations are can be helpful for both those who are overly concerned or messy.”Or you could just have a chat. “Everyone has different standards for hygiene and tidiness, and this will just be made more apparent when living with each other all day in lockdown,” says Mansell. Often it is easy to assume what is behind another person’s messy or fussy behaviour – and easy to get it wrong. So the solution is to talk, ask and listen.Not everyone is taking the outbreak as seriously as they need to. For every anxious housemate, there is one who is still going out and visiting friends. Some of the myths around Covid-19 have endured since the initial outbreak. People are still comparing it to seasonal flu and concluding that the lockdown is an overreaction, while some still think being young and healthy makes you invulnerable. These myths are especially convincing when bouncing around an echo chamber. If one of your housemates is trapped in one, there are ways to bring them out. “Try to understand that some people are reacting to the current situation with denial,” says Patel-Dunn “Be honest and try and use ‘I’ statements so as to not make your housemate feel defensive: ‘I am feeling uncomfortable as I don’t feel you are following social-distancing rules. This is making me worried that we are all going to get sick.’ It can be helpful to gently direct them to what local and national officials are recommending.”Those of us lucky enough to still have a job are working from our beds, sofas and kitchen tables. But if everyone in your household is having to work from home there could be landgrabs for the best spot.I have been practising bedroom journalism since the lockdown began, but others might prefer to keep their workspace separate from where they sleep. Lee Chambers, an environmental psychologist and founder of the life-coaching company Essentialise Workplace Wellbeing, says communication is key. “It really comes down to scheduling, designating spaces and making it really clear,” he says. “You need to actively listen when people are expressing concerns or difficulties. Try to designate yourselves a workspace – one particular space that is sanitised.”Dr Elena Touroni, a consultant psychologist and co-founder of the Chelsea Psychology Clinic, agrees. “Ultimately, it comes down to communication and negotiation,” she says. “Ensure that there is a fair amount of taking it in turns if you need to be sharing the living room, for instance. That’s going to save anyone from feeling resentful or as though their needs aren’t being met.”Many of us suddenly find ourselves with all the time in the world to twiddle our thumbs or use them to turn the volume up on our sound systems. “Just be mindful of how your flatmates live. The technology is there to make sure that you’re not disturbing each other,” says Chambers. Using headphones is essential. “There is a lot of social communication going on now across video platforms.”Approaching your housemates about this can be difficult, especially if you don’t know them very well – or at all. “It is important to stay calm and try not to get upset as this won’t be helpful,” says Patel-Dunn. Like cooking and cleaning, devising a plan around work and play could be the way to go. “Asking your housemates to all work on setting up a schedule for everyone to abide by in the house, including quiet time, can be helpful in showing respect for one another’s time and creating a routine,” she adds.Storming out is not really an option at the moment, especially if you’ve already used your approved daily dose of exercise. So, as Flounce City is officially closed, conflict-resolution techniques are called for. “There is no right way to end an argument,” says Mansell. “Again though, as soon as you can shift the argument to ‘I want …’ and ‘It makes me feel …’, rather than ‘You do …’ and any overtly or implicitly critical comments, the better. Remind yourself that the goal is always some kind of compromise and understanding of the other person’s point of view, and never just to ‘win’.”With the lack of testing, we are all having to become expert symptom spotters, but we need to be careful about alarming people. “It will depend very much on what your existing relationship is with them as to when to tell them,” says Mansell. “If you are hesitant to tell them, think why. Is your worst fear about telling them likely to happen or not?”If someone in your household presents with the common symptoms (a fever and persistent cough) then you should follow the official guidelines, self-isolate and take steps to improve the hygiene in your home.“Probably not!” says Touroni. “The reality is that you’re going to have to spend a considerable period of time with them, and it might end up becoming uncomfortable for both of you if the feelings aren’t reciprocated. This is not the time to be taking major relational risks, particularly as we don’t have access to the same coping mechanisms or distractions that would otherwise provide us with some comfort.”"

However, the financial impact of the pandemic hasn’t been evenly distributed. While a record 6.65 million Americans filed for unemployment last week, others are working from their homes. Others, from their vacation homes. Here, eight people from different walks of life tell us how the current crisis is (or isn’t) affecting them financially.I recently started my career as a barber and we were all just laid off due to Covid-19 and told to file for unemployment. I live in a one-bedroom apartment with my boyfriend in Oklahoma City. He graduated in December and has been looking for a job since. Job postings have closed but luckily he just got hired at Target.We’re very worried about making rent, which is $620 a month and due on the third. The only thing my landlord has said is payments are due online. So we’ve been doing Postmates and I’ve been making and delivering pies, trying to make a little money. Postmates pays $6 or $7 a delivery; I’ve made $130 selling pies so far. I don’t have savings. I’m honestly just going day by day hoping people buy pies and I don’t have to beg my parents for money.I’ve got a background in fashion and hospitality, but for the past year and a half I’ve been living off the returns of bond funds and equities. So, for example, in the beginning of January I got disbursements that yielded $45,000. And I get payouts like that every few months. Not always for that amount, but it’s extremely livable.The current situation hasn’t really made me more worried about money. But getting a statement from my financial advisers outlining my losses for February was not an easy pill to swallow. When the market tanked because of coronavirus the value of my investments decreased by nearly $100,000 in value. I almost cried. OK, that’s a lie, I did cry.My spending habits haven’t really changed. I mean, I’m not dropping $600 on dinners at the Grill or the Beatrice. However, I’ve probably spent the same amount I usually do on other “necessities” ranging from Caviar, to online shopping, to Ubers. Also, I say this from a beachfront resort in St Thomas – so I guess it hasn’t really changed my spending much.Coronavirus is the second devastating blow in two years to the sex work market. The first was in 2018 with the passing of Fosta-Sesta (the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act). Those bills meant online publishers would be liable if sex workers posted ads on their platforms and, as a result, websites banned sex workers, and scores of our ad platform sites shuttered themselves. Vulnerable workers were pushed onto the streets. Pimps were texting us en masse saying: “The game has changed, you need us baby.” It destroyed the independence of many sex workers, and left us exposed to more trafficking. In-person sex work has been decimatedSo what’s happening now has to be seen in the context of an already flagging market. I’ve been a sex worker since 2002 and was escorting in 2008 and 2009. Back then we were told that vice is inelastic, right? That actually had some level of truth to it at the time. I was able to survive well enough through that recession. But this time, because in-person contact has become hazardous, it’s different. In-person sex work has been decimated.I have about $80 in my bank account now and I have no idea where the next money is coming from. I’m surviving financially by upcharging a few regular clients for sexting or phone sex, and luckily at this point I haven’t been existing purely on sex work. I think I might be able to pay my rent. Also, non-criminal evictions are not proceeding in Massachusetts, so there’s that. But even so, back rent would destroy me. I’m just trying to take things day by day. I can’t afford to stockpile food. I just have enough for the next two or three days. (Though I have got cat food for a week because priorities!) So I’m planning really early morning trips to the local dollar store because I live in a food desert in a tiny, economically depressed ex-mill town. But still, I want to say, if I say nothing else, that my position is really privileged as compared to other low-income sex workers. At least I have a home to isolate myself in.On paper I don’t make enough for the government stimulus to help me at all. And I wouldn’t be eligible for unemployment; it’s all part and parcel of being in a criminalized profession. There are relief funds that have been started for sex workers. But – as is common with any crisis hitting the sex work market – all the people giving to these funds are other sex workers. We have no political allies. We have no allies except each other.I just turned 65 in March and was planning to retire next July. There was a countdown calendar on my phone and everything. I was putting 20% of my pay into my 403(b) for retirement; it was doing great and everything was on track. I talked to my financial adviser less than eight weeks ago about it and he said: “Let’s just sit on it for a while, you might want to move some things around in April.” Well, then everything came crashing down. In the course of a week I lost a quarter of my investments. I met with my adviser immediately and told him to move everything to a savings account. Then I went to work and said: “Guess what? I’m not retiring next year after all.”My body hurts, my brain is tired. I’ve been working in healthcare for 45 years. As much as I enjoy what I do, I’m ready to be done. It’s incredibly disheartening having all your plans whipped out from under you. I’ll never make back the money that I lost. My friends are in similar positions.I understand that I’m better off than a lot of people in that I have anything set aside for retirement. And there’s really no one to blame for what happened. But I will tell you I really wish that Richard Burr [a Republican senator who sold off his investments at a very opportune moment] had called me and told me to change my stock portfolio.I’m a freelance actor and writer, and juggle lots of other jobs such as tutoring to pay the bills. Pretty much all my creative work has disappeared overnight. I’ve been fortunate enough to have some tutoring jobs via Zoom still, but that’s not very much money. I’m probably going to get about £600 ($743) a month from the government, which is based on 80% of how much I was earning over the past three years. Some of my freelance friends who have been on maternity leave aren’t getting anything.I live hand-to-mouth generally. I have roughly about a month buffer. My foolproof plan was that I could always just make extra money working in a bar or as an usher. But all of that’s gone. Creatives know we’ve chosen a financially risky life. But you graft and you are prepared to do other things to make it work. I just didn’t realize I had to make my career virus-proof.Rent is one of the biggest worries. I’m really fortunate that my landlady is lovely. She’s said she won’t evict me but I’m still worried that I’m going to accrue lots of months of rent debt.The current situation has highlighted which budgeting habits I’ll change when this is over. There will be less grabbing coffee and food on the run. I’ve been going through subscriptions I have and seeing if I really need them. Obviously the gym has been canceled; I can do workouts at home. I’ve started to re-evaluate how I’ve lived my life. Do I really need to be in London to do what I do?I’m finishing up my PhD dissertation and have to find a job soon. Interviews would normally happen in August and September but I don’t see that happening now. I’m also worried about what will happen with the nature of the university itself – I worry that they will stick with virtual learning because it will lower costs. I foresee academia being shaped by this for the long term.The main scare for me is that there’s no prospect of my husband getting a job that’s safeGrants are also up in the air right now - which we depend on as academics. I’ve already received a finishing grant which means my income from the year is $28,000. My husband is in logistics and he was laid off at the start of the panic. We rely primarily on him for the mortgage. We are OK for the next few months but talking to the mortgage provider and seeing if we can reduce payments is on my list of things to do. The main scare for me is that there’s no prospect of my husband getting a job that’s safe. We have a new baby who just came out of NICU; she was there for respiratory problems. I also have asthma. So it’s not safe for my husband to do Uber work or work in a grocery store. It’s a really unsure future for all of us.I’ve always been type A about budgeting because I’ve not always been financially secure – my single mom was always trying to make ends meet. However, I’ve started planning even more; particularly around food. I wasn’t one of the types running out to get toilet paper, I just wanted to have enough food in the house. When it comes to utilities that can be negotiated up to a point; food can’t.Until recently I was employed at the Outback Steakhouse in Massachusetts as a server and bartender. My wife worked there as well and was also laid off. There were some grants available but I didn’t qualify for because I was under the hour minimum because I supplement my income driving part time for Uber, Lyft and DoorDash. We were still catching up on bills from the birth of our daughter, and this pandemic put a hard halt to our momentum. We’ve basically had to go into panic mode and pay only the bills that are most time sensitive or urgent.I work at the University of Iowa as a creative coordinator. One of my main responsibilities is designing marketing materials for events. Well, there are no longer any events to market! I am lucky to still be receiving pay checks but there’s a chance I could lose my job in the next year. I am one of the most recently hired staff, so I could be the first to let go if they need to save money.My husband lost his job on 11 March. He managed a cafe in one of the buildings on campus. We live in a small yet expensive apartment near the downtown area. He is not able to pay for his share of rent, utilities, or groceries until he can find another job. And right now … no one is hiring.I am lucky to have a large audience on Twitter and Instagram; my accounts became popular after I began writing horoscopes every Sunday. So I have the opportunity to market my skills to my audience and receive a small income. Which is something I have not considered until now. Once the reality of our situation set in I asked my followers how they would feel about paying $5 for a three-card tarot reading. After receiving about 150 requests via email, I closed the service temporarily to ensure I had time to get to all of them. So, for now, I am not too worried about money. This has given me the opportunity to make a little money on the side as a safety net.I own barre3, a fitness studio in Iowa; we opened exactly one year ago. We’re doing the best we can and have transferred a fraction of our classes over to livestream. But the equipment needed to set up other instructors to teach from their homes is cost prohibitive. We’re down about 60% in revenue this month and I’m unsure how long I can keep my current members with this setup. Without the revenue from members’ recurring payments, I’m not sure how long we will last. I’m thankful for the aid packages for small businesses just passed but understanding it and how to receive it is overwhelming. And I’m unsure if it will be enough for my business.My husband is a software developer; his work hasn’t been affected. Having a steady income through this is letting me sleep at night. We recognize that while we are taking a hit other people are worried about their next meal. So we’re spending a lot more on money on takeout than we would normally to try and help the local community. We’re also trying to get our groceries from a small grocer rather than the big brands.I have two boys, ages eight and four. We’re saving about $800 this month in childcare as my parents watched my younger one when he wasn’t in preschool but we’d much prefer to pay the money. We don’t feel prepared to teach them nor do we have the time to do it. We purchased both of them iPads so we could work with fewer interruptions – we’re concerned about the amount of screen time they are getting but we just don’t know how to make it all work. I feel pulled in a million directions and that I’m doing none of my roles (mother, business owner, boss, wife, friend, daughter, sister) well."

But everyone is determined that it won’t take education away from our children.”Asked if schools will return in term 2, Tehan confirmed the Northern Territory will proceed “as normal” while Western Australia and South Australia are also considering their circumstances.Jackson said that universities use “a wide range of methods to assess and admit students – in addition to the Atar”.“For year 12 students, these include assessment of a student’s results across year 11 and 12, especially in the subjects most relevant to the degree the student has applied for,” she said.“Universities can review portfolios of students’ work and take extra-curricular activities into account.“Where appropriate, universities use aptitude tests. All universities offer a variety of bridging, foundation and enabling courses to prepare students for university, providing another pathway.”"
"11","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-legal-action-could-undo-government-order-that-cruise-ships-leave-australian-waters","2020-04-07T04:22:06-0400","  Coronavirus: legal action could undo government order that cruise ships leave Australian waters ","Legal action launched by tour company APT could strike out a government order that all cruise ships leave Australian waters as soon as possible, causing substantial problems for the Morrison government’s management of the coronavirus crisis.APT has asked the federal court to rule that the part of a determination made on 27 March by health minister Greg Hunt that ordered foreign-registered cruise ships to leave Australian waters “as soon as reasonably practicable” is invalid.The company is trying to stop the government forcing its ship, the Caledonian Sky – a relatively small Bahamas-flagged cruise ship that is currently in Darwin’s harbour – from Australian waters.However, at a brief hearing held by videolink on Tuesday morning, judge Angus Stewart said that an order of the type sought by APT “potentially affects all foreign cruise vessels in Australian territory and not only the particular vessel otherwise directly affected by this case”.He asked APT to notify the attorney general of the lawsuit and said it would be heard at noon on Wednesday, possibly by the full bench of the court.Border Force commissioner Michael Outram has given an undertaking to the court not to remove the Caledonian Sky or its crew from Australia until 5pm on Thursday.Speaking in Canberra, Outram said Border Force was “working through” the APT case.“But let me make clear the government’s policy intent here is that all cruise ships that are in Australian waters that are not flagged or registered in Australia are to depart Australian waters and we’re working to achieve that outcome,” he said.Asked whether the case could have wider implications, he said that “every ship’s individual”.“But what I would I say is this: all of the ships we’re focused [on] here are either registered in or flagged in another country”.APT has been contacted for comment.While the Caledonian Sky has capacity for just 114 passengers, several much larger cruise ships that can each accommodate thousands of people remain in Australian waters, including the virus-riddled Ruby Princess.Cruise ships are generally registered in tax havens including Panama, Malta and the Bahamas, rather than high-tax jurisdictions such as Australia – a decision that has now come back to bite the industry.Outram said he had considered applications by cruise operators who wanted to keep their ships in Australian waters and rejected them all.He said that when Hunt made his determination there were 20 cruise ships in Australian waters.“Thirteen of those 20 have left, or are in the process of leaving today, Australian ports and seas,” he said.“And by Thursday we expect a further four to have departed.”He said this removed about 13,500 workers from Australian waters who, if they had become sick, would have been “a big strain on the Australian health system”.Luxury liner the Queen Elizabeth was expected to leave Brisbane on Tuesday for an unknown destination even though it has no cases of coronavirus and has been sitting off Gladstone for more than two weeks.The only Australian member of the crew, Gordon Dedman, who plays the trumpet in the ships’ Royal Court Theatre orchestra said he had been told to prepare to disembark, as the ship’s owners Cunard did not know where the ship would go and it was uncertain whether he could be easily returned to Australia.There are more than 900 crew on board including from the Philippines, India, the UK, US and Canada.“I would rather stay,” Dedman said. “I know this is a safe environment, because no one on board has coronavirus and we’ve been in isolation for more than two weeks.”“It seems we are all being tarred with one brush. Australia’s name will be rubbish in the cruise at the end of this crisis,” he said.He said Cunard, part of the Carnival group, has been “fantastic” to the crew.The Queen Elizabeth arrived in Sydney on 15 March after a short cruise to Tasmania and Melbourne. Before that it had been to Papua New Guinea.That same day, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced a ban on cruise ships. Dedman said the crew were permitted off the ship by health authorities and boarded again at 2am before travelling to Gladstone, where the ship has been moored since.On 19 March the Ruby Princess returned from New Zealand, with several sick passengers on board. There is now a criminal investigation into how the ship was allowed to disembark more than 2,700 passengers in Sydney before test results for three passengers came back. The incident has led to more than 600 cases of Covid-19 in Australia and several deaths.The Queen Elizabeth, along with all other cruise liners, has now been ordered out of Australian waters and is in Brisbane refuelling and taking on supplies before departing for an unknown destination.The ship is flagged out of Bermuda but has Southhampton in the UK as its home port.Dedman said he faces 14 days isolation in Brisbane, and possibly further isolation when he crosses back into NSW to return home.When he is not playing in cruise ship bands he runs bushcraft survival courses for the Army Reserve in northern Australia."

 Celebrities, coronavirus has exposed how irrelevant you have become ","We Are the World. In 1985, the omniscient eyes of Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan and seemingly every other top artist witnessed what was obscured from our living room windows. It took Grammy winners to tear our hearts and wallets open to the struggles of starvation in Africa, to the tune of more than $60m. The artists whose voices personally shook our inner-core were the same philanthropists we trusted to enlighten us on issues larger than our own infinitesimal lives.With the entire global population in varied stages of coronavirus quarantine in 2020, the time has never been been more opportune for our favorite artists to relieve the world once again. Unfortunately for those with blue checkmarks on Twitter and Instagram, the era of star-studded thoughts and prayers appears to be over.When Elton John and some of biggest musicians in the world livestreamed a Covid-19 benefit concert in front of 8 million, the other 7.45 billion captive viewers opted out.The celebrity tune-out continued on social media.Wonder Woman Gal Gadot and her gang of fellow actors inspired a thousandfold more criticism and cringe than goodwill for their atonal rendition of John Lennon’s unifying-with-no-heaven manifesto Imagine.Vanessa Hudgens quashed any hope for a celebrity epidemiologist to emerge when she wokefully expressed to her fans: “Even if everybody gets it, like yeah, people are going to die, which is terrible … but inevitable?”When tips on maintaining physically safe-distanced fitness routines from their indoor pools and remote personal trainers on video chat failed to save the world, the cultural elite wised up to content people were actually seeking.Through multiple failed attempts at prying relevance from the vice grip of a global pandemic, the celebrity industrial complex quickly pivoted its outreach strategy from unification and togetherness to one of cautious utility and ominous warning.Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Samuel L Jackson and even David Letterman popped out of the coffin to echo World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warnings about maintaining social distance and “staying the fuck at home” with cute songs and selfies.Driven by a narcissistic and possibly sociopathic desire to parent, what happens when no one listens to the celebrities that know best during a time of crisis? If the rich and famous are unable to guide our moral compass, who serves as the magnetic north?To date, not one star has been able to approach the meteoric Covid-19 stardom of Dr Anthony Fauci, longtime US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director. Fauci’s press conferences and messaging have inspired trending hashtags, fan pages, memes and even bobbleheads and prayer candles. Holding his role since 1984, Fauci never had any cause to become a household name, until now.Some of the best creative inspiration in history has come from those not born into the monopoly of creativity. Fauci, Governors Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gavin Newsom of California, and even polarizing Donald Trump have captured the nation’s attention with their regular public responses and working solutions to the coronavirus crisis.Where government officials and doctors are now the celebrated authorities for news and knowledge, people stuck at home are finally relying on each other for unity and entertainment. Happy hours are taking place between friends who may have never been able to grab a drink together in real life, while an entire cottage industry of backgrounds for the video chat platform Zoom has popped up.When Tom Hanks revealed he had coronavirus, we realized celebrities really are just like us. And that’s what’s disappointingThe meme-makers on Reddit and lip-syncing dancers on TikTok are getting the nation to connect and pay attention with their daily challenges, pranks and heartfelt safety warnings. They’ve turned Covid-19 into the great equalizer, proving that it takes a good thought to have influence, not the other way around.With no red carpet premieres or glamorous awards shows, the only stars being clapped for are healthcare workers every evening at 7pm. When Tom Hanks revealed he had coronavirus, we realized celebrities really are just like us. And that’s what’s disappointing.It might be a reflection of not only the pandemic, but of the times in general, that celebrity influence is waning. Sure, the K-pop supergroup BTS routinely induces fans into fainting across the globe, but we will probably never have another king of pop who can rally the entire planet into caring and taking action.Thirty-five years after We Are the World, we’re left to wonder, who actually was the we?Rohit Thawani works at the intersection of tech and advertising.

Covid-19 myths busted ","Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill – ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.However, masks will probably make little difference if you’re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply.All viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes Covid-19 is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection – the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most “successful”. This doesn’t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted.Genetic analysis by Chinese scientists of 103 samples of the virus, taken from patients in Wuhan and other cities, suggests that early on two main strains emerged, designated L and S. Although the L strain appeared to be more prevalent than the S strain (about 70% of the samples belonged to the former), the S branch of the virus was found to be the ancestral version.The team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more “aggressive”, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage – there haven’t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms.Many individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But Bruce Aylward, a WHO expert, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country’s response, said this has not been the case with Covid-19. The evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally.Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.’Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

","It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:A high temperature – you feel hot to touch on your chest or back.A new continuous cough – this means you have started coughing repeatedly.As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try to halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.As of 6 April, more than 1.2m people have been infected in 181 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 69,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 15,800 fatalities, and Spain has seen more than 12,000 deaths. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country – over 337,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 262,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in, but estimates of the mortality rate have ranged from well below 1% in the young to over 3% among those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. Seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

He has received oxygen support and one of the reasons for being in intensive care is that he can receive any support he needs.”Gove said the prime minister had made clear that Raab was his deputy, who would chair meetings and take decisions that will be followed through.He said Raab, the foreign secretary, would be leading the coronavirus response meeting on Tuesday morning and other cabinet committees but the “prime minister always remains the prime minister”.He said “decisions would be taken collectively and following appropriate advice” on when to end the lockdown.“But we do have to follow the lockdown advice because, as the prime minister’s case so powerfully reminds us, this disease can hit any of us and it can hit very badly,” he said.Gove said he could not talk about who has control of the nuclear codes if the country comes under attack as it was a national security matter.He rejected the idea of a national unity government but said that the opposition had been “exemplary” in saying they would support a united national effort to beat coronavirus. The prime minister was moved to intensive care on Monday evening. He remained conscious on Monday night.A No 10 spokesman said on Monday: “Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital.“The prime minister has asked foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who is the first secretary of state, to deputise for him where necessary. The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication.”Intensive care beds are reserved for those who are very ill, and in the case of Covid-19, often those who need to be put on a mechanical ventilator to help them breathe. Since first being admitted to St Thomas’, Johnson, 55, is understood to have received oxygen through a non-invasive mask only.His pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds – herself recovering from coronavirus symptoms – was said to be deeply anxious about Johnson’s condition.News of his admission to hospital, 11 days after he developed a cough and high temperature, caused national and international concern, with world leaders from the US president, Donald Trump, to the French leader, Emmanuel Macron, sending their best wishes and hopes for Johnson’s recovery.Trump said on Monday: “We’re very saddened to hear that [Johnson] was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery. He’s been a really good friend. He’s been really something very special: strong resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up.”Shortly after the announcement, Raab appeared on the airwaves with an attempt to reassure the public, saying government business would continue. He told the BBC there was an “incredibly strong team spirit” behind Johnson and that ministers would focus on delivering the plans he had put in place.He said the prime minister was in safe hands and receiving excellent care and vowed that the government would bring the whole country through the pandemic.Buckingham Palace said of the Queen: “Her Majesty has been kept informed by No 10.”"

Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days.Even by Pina Bausch’s standards it’s an arrestingly intense opening: a huge wall collapses on stage and across the rubble comes Julie Shanahan, in high heels and a floral frock. After desperately commanding hugs from two suitors, she takes a seat and is pelted by rotten tomatoes. And so begins an epic patchwork of masochistic rituals, nightmares and games, blending the quotidian with the phenomenal, all inspired by the choreographer’s trip to Sicily. A rare chance to watch one of Bausch’s creations in full and for free online.At first sight they could be Pina Bausch’s dancers: a procession of performers wearing smart suits and enigmatic smiles, gliding across a stage filled with apples. Bausch’s company memorably balanced apples on their heads in Palermo Palermo, but as Smashed is created by those juggling supremos Gandini, the fruit is mostly in motion here. Their Bausch homage has the same childlike games, adult fantasy and bruised humour of the German choreographer’s work. Smashed is crisp, fresh and full of flavour. You may never look at an apple in the same way again …If you missed its run at Soho’s new Boulevard theatre, here’s a chance to savour Dave Malloy’s song cycle, filmed in New York in 2015. Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It’s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience – but you’ll have to pour your own I’m afraid.All four productions in Classic Spring’s starry Oscar Wilde season in the West End can be watched on the online service Marquee TV, which is offering a 30-day free trial.

It’s available to stream online for free, with the option to donate to help provide financial and emotional support to theatre workers.London’s Unicorn theatre has a world-class reputation for theatre for young audiences and its production of Evan Placey’s Girls Like That gripped the roomful of teenagers I watched it with in 2014. It’s online in full and offers a raw account of adolescent anxiety, slut-shaming and self-belief. In-your-face theatre that stays in your mind.Think dance on ice and you’d imagine sequins and staggering TV celebrities, but the Canadian troupe, Le Patin Libre, has taken the art form into a new dimension. In their double bill, Vertical Influences, the skaters turned the rink into a mesmerising stage slowly decorated by the patterns cut by their blades.LIVR is a subscription service that enables you to catch up on theatre in 360-degree virtual reality. Pop your smartphone into the headset they send you and experience a range of shows including Apphia Campbell’s Fringe First award-winning show Woke, which interweaves the stories of Black Panther Assata Shakur and the 2014 Ferguson riots.Self-isolation may mean that many of us will use living rooms to both teach children and watch theatre. An opportunity to combine the two can be found courtesy of the super-charismatic John Leguizamo – an inspirational tutor if ever there was – whose one-man Broadway show, Latin History for Morons, is on Netflix.On Friday 27 March, to mark World Theatre Day, the Royal Court released an online version of David Ireland’s blistering play Cyprus Avenue, starring Stephen Rea as a Belfast loyalist who is convinced his baby granddaughter is Gerry Adams. The film mixes the drama shot at the Royal Court with location scenes of Belfast.Two households, both alike in dignity … well, sort of. Our narrator, a talking portrait, lays our scene in Victorian London, and this musical comedy imagines the founding of the popular shoe-repair chain as a union between two companies, the Montashoes and the Keypulets. Watch Gigglemug Theatre’s show on YouTube.This is cheating as it’s a TV series, but BBC Three’s superb comedy drama is based on one of the most uproarious and affecting fringe theatre shows of recent years. It’s based on Michael Patrick’s own teenage experience of a medical condition that left his testicle “so big you could play it like a bongo”. Wince.Love dance? Need to exercise at home?

 We say we value key workers, but their low pay is systematic, not accidental ","This weekend brought the news that two workers at London’s Pentonville prison, Bovil Peter and Patrick Beckford, had died with symptoms of Covid-19. “Symptoms” is nowadays a euphemism for “they weren’t tested”, and a grim reminder of the hundreds of thousands of key workers we are asking the world of, but whose selflessness is not being reciprocated.These are tragedies laced with guilt for all of us: plainly, the most dangerous place to be during this epidemic is in a densely populated care environment, whether a hospital, school or prison. People work in them because they have a passion, but also because there is no alternative, and they do so on all our behalves.Prison officers have always been the unsung heroes of public duty: never quite macho enough for the people who glorify the armed forces; always a bit too authoritarian for those who valorise nurses. They are some of the most inventive and diligent people working anywhere in the business of caring for others, but they have generally done so without much credit.This crisis is forcing an urgent re-evaluation of that, along with all those other jobs that were previously classed as low-value yet now turn out to be the most important in the country. Words are not enough, and nor is clapping; you can praise care workers to the skies, but if you’re paying them the minimum amount in 15-minute segments, without security of hours or of employment, without sick or holiday pay, then the praise is hollow.You can wax sentimental about the holy vocation of nursing, but you cannot then bring second-year students on to the frontline to fight coronavirus and still expect them to pay their tuition fees. You cannot claim, as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told Andrew Marr on Sunday, that this isn’t the right time to talk about pay rises; it is the best and only time to talk about pay rises, when we have finally realised, with a jolt, just how much we rely on people who put their jobs ahead of their own safety.Yet this is about more than money: Keir Starmer accepted the Labour leadership on Saturday with the rousing Old Testament statement about all key workers, cleaners, paramedics, carers, porters: “For too long they’ve been taken for granted and poorly paid. They were last and now they should be first.” But what would it actually mean to put these jobs first? Money is some of the answer, but we also have to look at the conditions and assumptions that drive wage stagnation and the steady erosion of security.There is nothing radical in the observation that jobs are often described as low-skill, when actually they are just poorly paid. More radical, yet still accurate, is the assertion that they are characterised as “low-skill” deliberately. Caring is a job of tremendous skill, hard as well as soft. And while there is a huge amount of bolt-on expertise that employers require, from administering medicines to dealing with dementia, this is not reflected in any career progression. It is not unusual for a carer in her 40s to be on the same hourly rate, adjusted for inflation, that she was on at 18.This has been systematic, not accidental. Without progression, the wage bill can remain reliably static, which is the only way the financial architecture of the sector makes sense.There is often better progression in public sector work, but the combination of the austerity-years pay freeze and a new normal (extending even to the police) of people at the start of their career being expected to work voluntarily, which itself erodes starting salaries, has had a striking effect on these jobs.Ironically, Theresa May was right when she famously said that a nurse might use a food bank for “complicated reasons”. Of course there’s a very simple reason – that nurse is not being paid enough. But the feedback loop between the private and public sectors – low pay, insecurity and poor conditions legitimised in one sector and migrating to another – is actually quite complicated.And there’s an overarching fallacy, that a job many people could do must be inherently low in value. By these lights, huge numbers of people – cleaners, drivers, shop assistants – are without prospects, being so replaceable. The times are testing this assumption to destruction – when you’re looking for the people whose courage we need in order for civilisation to survive, you don’t have to look much further than the postal worker or the hospital porter.In the immediate term, putting key workers first means personal protective equipment; it means collective and determined effort to strip as much risk as possible out of essential jobs that simply wouldn’t get done if everyone looked out for themselves. But there will be an era after coronavirus; and one thing to carry into it will be a determination never again to think, talk about or treat people as though logic demands they should be screwed down to their lowest possible price.• Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"

I think it has brought out the absolute best in people.”Care workers are on the coronavirus frontline and many have reported their concerns over severe shortages of personal protective equipment. But Smith has been keen to ensure that spirits are kept high among the 49 residents at the home near Ipswich.People have been kinder to each other – I hope society can keep that little nugget of lovelinessVisits from families, activity providers and the local community are an integral part of daily life in a care home. But during lockdown, providers are using other ways of keeping residents connected.“We know how important it is that people can stay in touch with their friends and relatives,” says Sara Livadeas, chief executive of the Fremantle Trust. “Knowing that someone cares about you is a basic human need. It also provides reassurance to relatives who have entrusted the care of their loved ones to others.”The trust, which supports approximately 1,200 older people and people with learning disabilities, is using video calling technology across its homes and services to enable contact with friends and family.Some of its homes have also been setting up appointments allowing relatives who live nearby to visit during their daily walk. They can sit outside while chatting on the phone, meaning people can see their loved ones “in the flesh”.Lilian Faithfull Care, which runs five homes in Gloucester, has also been using technology to keep its 300 residents in touch with their families.“The homes are taking lots of pictures every day of residents doing activities and sending them so people can be reassured,” says Kelly Richardson, Lilian Faithfull Care’s marketing and fundraising manager.“They are living their daily lives – taking part in activities such as singing, reading, painting, flower arranging or sitting outside in the garden. They have got the companionship of each other and care teams, and we are concentrating on keeping families up to date, sending newsletters or posting pictures on Facebook.”Lilian Faithfull is part of the Postcards of Kindness project, which asks people to write to care home residents, and is using social media and local papers to encourage those in the area to send in letters and pictures. Residents have also been painting rainbow pictures and displaying them at their windows, says Richardson, “to show they are passionate about keeping hopeful”.Homes across the country have been involved in projects to bring generations together, such as hosting nurseries or inviting in local schools. While physical visits have stopped during the coronavirus outbreak, intergenerational activities are continuing virtually.In Hampshire, the Sunrise of Fleet home hosted regular storytime sessions with the pupils from a local school coming in to read their favourite books. When schools in the area closed, the home put out a call via social media for children to take part in digital storytimes instead.Families have been getting in touch to take part in the sessions – with some of the children putting on their school uniform to read to the residents, who watch on iPads or a smart TV.Lisa Baxter, activities and volunteers coordinator, says parents who used to attend a mother and baby group at the home have been sending in videos so residents can keep up with the children’s milestones.Charity Kissing it Better brings generations together by asking young people to share their talents – which may include music, drama, dance, knitting or juggling – with older people in hospitals and care homes. Since the lockdown was introduced, its volunteers have been singing in the grounds of care homes, outside residents’ windows.In Suffolk, Smith says children living near the home have been sending in letters and pictures, and as people around the country joined the Clap for Carers, the home’s neighbours applauded her colleagues as they finished their shift.People have left toiletries and other treats for residents and staff, while a local homelessness charity gifted its surplus milk, break, cake and other treats.Smith says she’s already planning a garden party once the coronavirus crisis ends “because there’s a lot of people we need to say thank you to”.“People say they can’t wait for it to be over,” she says. “But the beautiful aspects – people have been kinder to each other and smiling at each other – I hope society can keep that little nugget of loveliness.”"

 Lifeboat Australia sets sail as government releases coronavirus modelling ","The federal government on Tuesday released elaborate modelling of the coronavirus spread which was entirely theoretical and had nothing to do with Australia.It was one of the odder moments of the public debate on Covid-19 over the past three weeks.Straight-shooter chief medical officer Brendan Murphy was asked by a reporter Tuesday whether the modelling “indicated anything about the relative effectiveness of different measures” employed in Australia.Murphy replied: “It doesn’t, unfortunately.”Which opens the question of why he was there, at a press conference in Canberra with Scott Morrison, unveiling a vast range of data and projections which had no application to this country.It is too early for the Australian experience have been modelled. There have been only about 500 cases from community contact – as opposed to those imported from other countries or cruise ships – and that isn’t a big enough tally to work on.But the graphs and tables on display did have a purpose – although not the one they were designed for – and it wasn’t a wasted occasion as far as the government and its advisers were concerned.It was an opportunity to quell the increasing “show us the modelling” demands. In effect the response was: You wanted modelling, you’ve got modelling, even though it is irrelevant to this country.More importantly, it was a tactic to underline the critical urgency of Australians continuing to follow the instructions to stay home, keep washing hands, and taking other measures to limit the Covid-19 menace.Expect over the coming few days more government pleas for Australians to maintain hygiene and social contact discipline, and to ignore the traditional Easter temptation to go travelling with the family.It was an opportunity to reinforce the success of these measures, and rank the Australian performance as superior to that elsewhere – even if there was no modelling to substantiate the boast.The prime minister and his top health adviser were looking over their shoulders rather than projecting ahead. They were directing attention, for example, to the strength of our health system in contrast to the frail structures overseas. Murphy said the national cabinet of federal and state leaders, who met Tuesday “has asked for a raft of options”, and promoted a cute analogy.“We have put ourselves on a life raft, unlike the US and other countries that are sitting in the water,” Murphy told reporters.“We are on a life raft. We have to chart the course of where we take that life raft.”Morrison made a similar point with considerably less poetry.He said the data showed “that by taking the measures that we are taking, you can make a difference”.The prime minister said those measures were “buying time, giving us the opportunity for more choices”."

A state-by-state breakdown ","A reduction in the number of new confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia has coincided with a decline in the number of people returning from overseas. Australian health authorities in a number of states and territories are now easing up previous restrictions on testing so that at-risk workers or those in hotspots can be tested for possible community transmission.If you suspect you have coronavirus in Australia and want to get tested, here’s a guide to the criteria in each state and territory. In all jurisdictions you remain eligible for testing if you are showing symptoms and you have recently been overseas or been in contact with a confirmed case.People with fever or flu-like symptoms in Sydney – Waverley, Woollahra, Dee Why, Manly, Ryde, Macquarie Park – and regional NSW: Broken Hill, Lake Macquarie, the Manning Valley, Nowra, south Nowra, Byron Bay and Port Macquarie can now get tested due to concerns about clusters in those areas. You also meet NSW testing criteria if you have a fever or respiratory illness and live in a high-risk location (aged care facilities, boarding houses etc), are an aged care or healthcare worker, identify as Aboriginal in a regional or remote community or have been referred by a GP for testing.Victorians who are over 65, school teachers, childcare workers and firefighters who attend medical emergencies can also get tested if they have symptoms. Healthcare workers, police, and aged care workers were already eligible to get tested.The Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young announced on Monday testing would be done in hotspots on the Gold Coast, Brisbane and in Cairns after 32 cases where the source of the transmission was unknown. The state’s other testing criteria includes people with a fever or respiratory illness and living in a high-risk location (aged care facilities, boarding houses etc), aged care or healthcare workers, and those who identify as Aboriginal in a regional or remote community.Western Australia expanded its testing last week to include any member of the general public who presents at a Covid-19 clinic with both a fever and an acute respiratory infection. High-risk workers with either of those conditions can get tested, and anyone in a high-risk setting like an aged care facility or detention centre where two or more people have either symptom can get tested.The ACT has random testing at Weston Creek and a drive-through testing clinic at Epic (Exhibition Park in Canberra), where anyone with coronavirus symptoms can get tested. You can get tested if you have symptoms and have travelled overseas or interstate in the past 14 days, if you have symptoms and have been in contact with a confirmed case, or if you have symptoms and you are a health or aged care worker.The existing conditions remain in place. That is, only people with symptoms who have travelled internationally or interstate recently or have had contact with a confirmed case can get tested. However, health and aged care workers with both a respiratory illness and fever can get also tested.You can get tested if you have returned from interstate or overseas in the past 14 days and develop a respiratory illness, or have been in contact with a confirmed case, or have severe community-acquired pneumonia and there is no clear cause, or you are a healthcare worker who has a respiratory illness and a fever.On Sunday, Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said the biggest concern in Australia was the community transmission, which accounts for about 10% of cases nationally.“I may sound like a broken record at times but community transmission is what worries me most of all,” he said.“Those are the reason we have brought in the social distancing measures and all the measures to stop the spread.”He said Australia was in a good place, and achieving good control because the community was mostly complying with what had been asked. He urged people to not travel or have parties over Easter."
"23","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/controversial-malaria-drug-hydroxychloroquine-to-be-given-to-coronavirus-patients-in-australia","2020-04-07T03:16:02-0400","  Controversial drug hydroxychloroquine to be given to coronavirus patients in Australia ","A controversial anti-malaria drug will be given to Australian Covid-19 patients in hospitals outside of clinical trials, the federal government confirmed, after the therapeutic goods registration requirements for two drugs were waived to allow them to be imported to and stockpiled in Australia.The drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, are being explored in clinical trials around the world for their potential as a coronavirus treatment to ease symptoms, or as a preventative drug to stop people being overcome with the infection. Trials are exploring use of the drugs on their own as well as in combination with others.But clinicians have warned that hydroxychloroquine can cause severe and even life-threatening side-effects, and have cautioned against using it for conditions for which it has not been tested. It is a proven treatment for malaria and for some autoimmune conditions.Studies on its efficacy as a Covid-19 preventative or treatment are mixed. Much of the focus on the drug came after a small French study, which has since been widely disputed and been found to have omitted data contain spurious results. A small study from China found no benefit to chloroquine being given to Covid-19 patients.Hydroxychloroquine has also caused division within the White House, Axios reported, after the US president, Donald Trump, hyped it as a “game changer” in treating the virus. The White House infectious disease expert warned Trump that evidence for the drug was only anecdotal and far from proven.A health department spokesman said the inclusion of the medicine in the national medical stockpile was based on not only its proven clinical uses, but on its potential clinical utility in the absence of a well-documented treatment.While “clinical trials are critical for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of potential treatments, before they are made available through the health system”, the spokesman said, the drug would be made available not only for clinical trials but “for use in hospitals for ill patients”.The government said under an emergency exemption to therapeutic goods registration requirements the drug would be sourced from overseas and imported, including intermediates and other raw materials so that local manufacturing could occur.The department confirmed that the former federal politician Clive Palmer, who has said he will produce 1m doses of the drug, has a prior written arrangement with the commonwealth and so his plan aligned with the emergency exemption.“It is anticipated that medicines containing hydroxychloroquine sulfate will be made available to the national medical stockpile from a number of pharmaceutical companies,” the spokesman said. “Some of these include generous donations funded by Mr Clive Palmer.”Novartis Pharmaceuticals Australia has also confirmed that it will provide doses. And the government is investing $1.5m to support guidance for clinicians to ensure they are given the best possible advice on managing Covid-19 patients.An infectious diseases expert and former World Health Organization adviser, Prof Peter Collignon, said he was concerned the stockpiling was being driven by hype and panic.“It a very bad idea to have panic driving drugs we are going to give to people and chloroquine is just an example of panic,” Collignon said.“It is very important to look at and evaluate these drugs around the world but to only issue these drugs after that evaluation. Or we run the risk of killing people.“I would be worried about it being made available in the absence of strong trials and doctors make panicked decisions. Panic can blur good science and doing things safely.”He said Australia was not overwhelmed with patients in hospitals like New York and London were, so Australia had time to make careful and considered clinical decisions.Dr Sacha Stelzer-Braid, a senior scientist in the virology research lab at the University of New South Wales and the Prince of Wales hospital, said while laboratory studies using hydroxychloroquine to inactivate the virus look promising, we still needed to be cautious about the possible use of the drug to shorten the duration of infection or even possibly prevent infection, if used prophylactically in healthcare workers, for example.“We do need to wait for the results of proper clinical trials to see whether the in vitro laboratory results translate to having any effects in humans,” he said.“It sounds like part of the stockpile will be used for these clinical trials in the first instance, which is a wise move. At the moment we don’t have any antivirals that we can use against the virus, so I can understand the move to acquire a drug that has preliminary evidence as possibly effective. However, I think we still need to be careful and observe our usual protocols of clinical trials, albeit at a more accelerated rate than usual.” "

That is one fifth the previous limit of five chats, imposed in 2019.Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs. As this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help.The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families.If you want to help, find your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund.Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use Feeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice.Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.The change does not completely prevent widespread forwarding, since ultimately a message can be passed on however many times a user is happy to hit the forward button.But by inserting friction into the process, the company hopes to slow some of the most viral messages on its platform, such as the widely spread falsehood that coronavirus is related to 5G. That claim has led to the vandalisation of more than 20 phone masts in the past week.“We’ve seen a significant increase in the amount of forwarding which users have told us can feel overwhelming and can contribute to the spread of misinformation,” said a WhatsApp spokesperson in a blogpost on Tuesday morning.“We believe it’s important to slow the spread of these messages to keep WhatsApp a place for personal conversation.”Because of the encryption WhatsApp uses, the company cannot see the contents of messages sent on its platform. That prevents it from employing the same moderation strategies as Facebook or Twitter, which can take down harmful content that is flagged.Instead, the company has long worked to introduce friction into messaging more generally, as well as provide users with information that could help them know whether a message is trustworthy.The latter is achieved by noting when a message has been forwarded or frequently forwarded – indicated with a double arrow icon – while the former has led to progressively stricter limits on mass mailings.Until 2018, for instance, users had been able to forward a message to 250 groups at once; that was reduced to 20 that year, five in 2019 and one now. WhatsApp says those measures reduced message forwarding by 25% globally.Widely forwarded messages can be particularly dangerous on WhatsApp, where they often come with the implicit approval of a friend or family member, and are rapidly disconnected from their initial context.But the company argues that not all forwarding is bad. “We know many users forward helpful information, as well as funny videos, memes and reflections or prayers they find meaningful. In recent weeks, people have also used WhatsApp to organise public moments of support for frontline health workers.”"

This is the opposite of Covid-19,” said the study’s lead author, Prof Russell Viner, of UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health.“Data on the benefit of school closures in the Covid-19 outbreak is limited but what we know shows that their impact is likely to be only small compared with other infection-control measures such as case isolation and is only effective when other social isolating measures are adhered to.”Viner, who is president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the benefit gained from closing schools had to be weighed against the costs. “Children’s education is damaged and their mental health may suffer, family finances are affected, key workers may need to stay home to look after children and vulnerable children may suffer most.”He also highlighted the need to start working out how to return students to education and keep them in school safely.“Countries that have closed schools, such as the UK, have to now ask hard questions about when and how to open schools. Interventions in schools, such as closing playgrounds, keeping students in constant class groups/classrooms, increasing spacing between students in classes, reducing the school week and staggering school start and break times across years or classes should be considered if restrictive social distancing policies are to be implemented for long periods of time.”Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, who is one of the key epidemiologists advising the government, said: “While school closure as a measure on its own is predicted to have a limited effectiveness in controlling Covid-19 transmission, when combined with intense social distancing it plays an important role in severing remaining contacts between households and thus ensuring transmission declines.”Robert Dingwall, a professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said the UCL study suggested the public health benefits of school closures were not proportionate to the social and economic costs imposed on children and their families.“It also underlines how the assumptions used in modelling the Covid-19 pandemic may rest on very flimsy foundations in terms of scientific evidence. This work suggests that UK schools could and should begin to reopen as soon as practicable after the initial wave of cases has passed through.”The study team included researchers from UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL Institute of Education, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, University of Cambridge and University of Sydney. The study is published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal.A government spokesperson said: “The decision to close schools was taken in line with scientific advice on how to limit the spread of the coronavirus. We asked most children to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives.“Schools will remain closed until further notice, except for children of critical workers and the children who are most vulnerable. We will reopen schools when the scientific advice indicates it is safe to do so.”"

While politicians have said these rules are simple, it is clear the public still has a lot of questions about coronavirus lockdown rules and restrictions.In most states enforcement is left up to police officers’ discretion, therefore it is difficult to provide exact information on what is or isn’t allowed.Here we try to answer some of the most common questions people have about the new laws based on the information, though these answers should not be treated as legal advice. An asterisk indicates Guardian Australia has sought clarification from the state or territory government and will update when it is received.New South Wales – Although legislation would suggest the answer is no, police commissioner Mike Fuller said on Wednesday that yes, you are allowed. This is considered to come under the “care” exemption.Victoria – Yes, while originally it appeared that you would not be allowed to see your partner, on Wednesday afternoon the Victorian chief health officer tweeted that an exemption to the no social visits rule would be made for partners.Queensland – Yes, on Thursday Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said households are allowed to have two additional guests at a time, but physical distancing should still be observed when possible. Outdoor gatherings are limited to two, or members of the same household.Tasmania – Yes. Tasmania has a broad definition of “social support” which is considered an essential reason for leaving the home. This allows for romantic partners and family members to still visit one another, however social distancing must still be observed and you are not permitted to stay overnight unless you have elected their home to be your primary residence from 31 March on.Australian Capital Territory – Yes, households are allowed to have two additional guests at a time, however, there must be at least four square metres per person indoors. Outdoor gatherings are limited to two, or members of the same household. Western Australia – Yes. The way WA is enforcing the two-person law means households are allowed to have one guest at a time. You will not be permitted to travel between the nine WA regions unless it is on “compassionate grounds”.South Australia and Northern Territory – Yes, there are currently no fines for leaving the house for non-essential reasons, however unnecessary socialisation is discouraged. Gatherings are limited to 10.All states currently allow you to leave the home, and meet with one person to do exercise. This means you are allowed to meet your partner or a friend in public to exercise with them. Some states have limits on how far you can travel for exercise, however.NSW – Yes, you are allowed to move house.Victoria – Yes,* you are allowed to move house.Queensland – Moving residences is not referenced in the legislation, Guardian Australia is seeking clarification.*Tasmania, ACT – Yes, you are allowed to move house.* WA – Yes, you are allowed to move house, but there may be restrictions on crossing regional borders.SA and NT – Yes, there are currently no fines for leaving the house for non-essential reasons.Yes, in all states you are allowed to leave your home for exercise, which includes dog walking. Social distancing measures should be observed while out, and in Victoria, NSW, Queensland, WA*, Tasmania and ACT, you can only be joined by one other person or those in your household.No states have specific rules on the distance you are allowed to travel to exercise, however many have appealed for people to use “common sense”.NSW – You are allowed to drive across town however you aren’t allowed to travel hours out of the city.Victoria – Premier Daniel Andrews said on Twitter exercise had to be local and not “driving for miles and being out all day”.ACT – There are no official limits, however, people are encouraged to avoid unnecessary travel, and where possible avoid areas where they are likely to come into close contact with others.Queensland and Tasmania – Not specified, however, the government urges residents to use common sense and avoid unnecessary travel. WA – You are not allowed to travel between the nine regions of Western Australia without good cause, such as work or compassionate reasons. Therefore exercise should be limited to your region and unnecessary travel avoided.SA and NT – There are currently no restrictions on the reasons for leaving your house, however, you are urged not to travel unless necessary. The federal government is recommending those over 70, those with chronic illness over 60 and Indigenous people over 50, self-isolate as much as possible. However, no state will currently issue penalties to those who do not.Therefore it’s recommended that elderly relatives do not look after children.NSW – Yes, it counts as “care”.Victoria – You are allowed to leave the home to provide caregiving, therefore likely yes.*Queensland – Yes, this constitutes ‘care’. Households are allowed to have two additional guests at a time, but physical distancing should still be observed when possible.Tasmania – Yes, it counts as “social support”.ACT – Yes, however, households are only allowed two guests at a time and there must be at least four square metres per person indoors.WA – Yes, families are generally exempt from the two-person gathering limits, however unnecessary social interaction is discouraged. You will not be permitted to travel between the nine WA regions unless you are caring for family members or on “compassionate grounds”.SA and NT – Yes, as long as a maximum of 10 people are at the gathering. NSW – Generally no.* On Wednesday police commissioner Mick Fuller said visiting romantic partners counted as “care” and was therefore allowed, however when Guardian Australia asked NSW police if visiting immediate family was also constituted as “care” they said that social visits do not count. We will seek further clarification on this issue. You can, however, visit family if you are caring for them, delivering them food, assisting with medication, taking them to the shops if they require assistance etc.Victoria – Generally no, social visits are not allowed. However, you can visit to deliver food, provide medical care and for “compassionate reasons”.Queensland – Yes, households are allowed to have two additional guests at a time, but physical distancing should still be observed when possible and unnecessary social gatherings should be limited.Tasmania – Yes, this falls under “social support”, however, only two visitors are permitted in homes at any one time and must be mindful of social distancing and avoiding unnecessary travel.ACT – Yes, however, households are only allowed two guests at a time and there must be at least four square metres per person indoors.WA – Yes, families are generally exempt from the two-person gathering limits, however, unnecessary social interaction is discouraged. The restrictions on travelling between WA regions also apply.SA and NT – Yes, as long as there are a maximum of 10 people at the gathering, however, unnecessary social interaction is discouraged. All states currently allow you to leave the home, and meet up with one person to do exercise. This means you are allowed to meet a family member in public to exercise with them. There are limits on how far you can travel for exercise, however, see above.Yes. Currently, all states allow you to uphold current shared parental agreements. This means you are allowed to drive your children to their other parent or carer’s residence, and they are allowed to visit your residence to pick children up.Yes. All states allow you to leave your home if you are legally required to do so. You are allowed to flee violence, and you are allowed to leave if your house becomes uninhabitable.All Australians have been urged to avoid unnecessary socialisation.NSW and Victoria – No, social visits are not allowed. Queensland – Yes, on Thursday Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said that those who live alone could have a social guest. No more than two guests are allowed in a household at a time.Tasmania – Yes, this falls under “social support”, however only two visitors are allowed at a time and must be mindful of social distancing and avoiding unnecessary travel.ACT – Yes, however, households are only allowed two guests at a time and there must be at least four square metres per person indoors.WA – Yes, but only one person, or family.SA and NT – Yes, but gathering must be limited to 10. NSW, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania – Yes, but only if it is takeaway and you have met a friend for the purpose of exercising.  ACT – Yes, as long as it is takeaway. WA, SA and NT – Yes, as long as it is takeaway. NSW – Yes you can drive a colleague to work with you, however, it is unclear if you can leave the house to drive someone to their job if you do not also work there. If they can not drive themselves this is likely covered under “care”.* You can only take one passenger or anyone who is part of your household.Victoria and Queensland – Yes you can drive a colleague to work with you. Driving someone else to work if they can not drive themselves likely falls under “providing care and support”. You can only take one passenger or anyone who is part of your household.* Tasmania – Yes, but there must be an essential reason for all passengers to be travelling in the vehicle.ACT – Yes, however, you can only take one passenger or anyone who is part of your household. It is encouraged you create as much distance between you and your passenger as possible, such as having them sit in the back seat.WA – Yes, but you can only take one passenger, family member or anyone who is part of your household. You will likely require a letter from your work if you wish to cross the border into another region within the state. SA And NT – Yes. Yes, however only if it is for essential works. If it can wait, it should.Physical distancing practices should be observed. NSW, Qld – The local authorities have explicitly said this is is a reasonable excuse to leave the house.Victoria – A teenager was fined for learning to drive in early April, but Victoria Police has indicated the fine will be reviewed.Western Australia – There is no specific advice, but Western Australia has been divided up into nine regions, and you cannot travel from one region into another region for a non-essential reason.Tasmania, SA, NT, ACT – No specific advice. Generally, enforcement will be left up to the discretion of police officers.States have expressed different approaches, for example, the ACT says it will be issuing a warning in the first instance, while Victoria has adopted a more hard-line attitude to those break social distancing rules.NSW Police commissioner Mick Fuller said on Thursday he would personally review all physical distancing fines issued in the state.“If I think it’s unreasonable, it will be withdrawn immediately and we’ll make personal contact with the individual,” he said.Not all states have specified this, however, it appears these fines can be appealed using the same process as other fines issued by police.Information on how to lodge an appeal should be available on your state or territory’s government website."

 In these scary times a hug would help, but it's the one thing I cannot have ","The last few weeks, I’ve been thinking a lot about different types of physical touch. Unfortunately, that is a sentence that is always going to sound inherently creepy, but I think I can get away with it, considering current circumstances. I’ve been thinking about the time at Mardi Gras a mere month ago when four of my friends attacked me with hugs and kisses, completely enveloping me in a storm of affection. Thinking about my Nanna grabbing my hand as we walk together, her laughing and clutching my arm as I attempt to convince her to try a burrito (which she refuses because she’s too white and afraid of flavour). Remembering the countless small touches with past lovers, like resting my hand on their thigh as we watch TV, or rolling over in bed at night, and having them move to spoon me instinctively.For a very, very long time, as a fat closeted youth, I shunned affection and hugging. When people wanted to hug me, I would tense up and make it an unpleasant experience for all parties. I felt so insecure in my physical body, that to let someone embrace me would make me feel ashamed. And I felt so scared and uncomfortable in my mind, and I could never let myself be vulnerable, or get close to other people physically. That all changed when later in life, I found my community and began to love myself. I am now what you would call, a “hug slut” (can I say slut in the Guardian? Who knows, it’s a pandemic). The older I’ve gotten, the more I’ve relied on physical affection from other people, especially friends. They are a constant; those you know will always be there to give you a hug when you are going through a hard time. Except for now, in this very specific hard time, when it could be used the most.At the forefront of my mind every day is that I can’t be touched by, or touch another human, for god knows how longAlmost everyone’s lives have suffered a sudden dramatic change. With the lockdown laws meaning you’re stuck indefinitely with whoever you happen to be living with, it’s sparked a conversation about which way of life would suck the most right now. Obviously the real answer to this is that it continues to suck the most for people it’s always sucked for – imprisoned refugees, prisoners, homeless people, the chronically ill, the elderly, people with disabilities, those in unsafe relationships, and all the other marginalised groups we’ve ignored.But a lot of the general public will now be struggling in ways they haven’t before, and we will all be facing our own challenges. For example, parents having to keep their children inside and entertained 24 hours a day while still working seems like a literal nightmare. The part I am struggling most with in my individual circumstance is the sudden and complete loss of affection. I’m anxious about other things, like losing work, but still at the forefront of my mind every day is that I can’t be touched by, or touch another human, for god knows how long. (Again, creepy but justified.) When there isn’t a pandemic on, being alone is great. I spend time socialising, seeing friends, dating, being affectionate, and I am fulfilled and sustained. Suddenly, with all that gone, everything else seems harder to cope with.Luckily, I am a very “online” person, and I am using the privilege of having the internet to its fullest extent. I am actually in contact more with people now per day than I would be usually. There’s texting, chatting, watching movies together, video calling, apps where you chat with whoever is around. But socially I am often switching between two kinds of people – there’s those who are in lockdown with friends or family or lovers, and those interactions make my desire for that even more acute. Or I am talking to other people in the same situation as me, and the almost-but-not-quite being present with each other leaves a hollow feeling when you close out of the chat window to sit alone again. The silence in the few seconds when you hang up, either way, is deafening. There’s never been more ways to connect with the people you love. But it’s not the same, and it’s not enough. Because the thing that is missing is touch.Seeing someone through a screen will never be the same as hugging hello. Human beings need touch to thrive. We need affection. We need skin contact. These are not the hippy feelings of a lesbian alone in her room for too long, this is actually science. When everything else in the world is scary like right now, the one thing that might help is being embraced by someone I love, and it’s the only thing I cannot have. It’s obviously not the most pressing issue facing us, but not knowing how long it will be until I can feel someone wrap their arms around me again fills me with dread. But I also know I’m privileged to have that be something I miss, and something I know I can look forward to on the other side of this. And I’ll never take it for granted again.• Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in Sydney• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

 When the Covid-19 crisis finally ends, UK schools must never return to normal ","From goodness knows where, in the last few weeks school and college leaders have pulled out all the stops. Despite 10 years of real-term funding cuts and ongoing fears of redundancies, the education profession has risen to the Covid-19 challenge.From nursery schools to further education colleges, colleagues have entrenched themselves in their communities, caring for the children of key workers and those at risk of harm while becoming distributors of food and providers of essential social care services.Hundreds of thousands of teachers and support staff are busy at home trying to provide a support system for parents and a semblance of routine for children and young people. Many are reassuring those who would have been taking GCSEs and A-levels, or providing online learning resources and marking coursework for students of applied qualifications.However, decisions and support from the Department for Education have been slow, reactionary, and leaked to the press rather than first shared with the profession. They have not been collaborative. School and college leaders, local authorities and trade unions have filled the gaping hole vacated by central government.One thing is clear, when this is over, society will be fundamentally changed. Children and their families, our school and college communities, will need considerable support to deal with illness and bereavement, changes in employment and housing situations.No adult or child will be untouched. When we come out of social distancing and isolation, children and young people and their families will need help to manage mental health, self-esteem, friendships and relationships.Education will need to change, too. We cannot simply return to the status quo. A third of teachers are actively thinking of leaving the profession within the next five years; there is a teacher and school leader recruitment crisis. Education support staff roles have been cut to the bone and teaching assistants, supporting the children with the most complex special needs, are being paid insultingly low wages that do not reflect their importance.Cancelling Sats tests and public exams was the right decision. However, it is not only the 2019-20 cohort who will be affected by this crisis. The education, physical and mental health of a generation is at stake. Children of NHS and other key and essential workers will see their parents exhausted and exposed to the biggest health risk in a hundred years.When we go back to school everything will be different – and it must be different. We need to ask ourselves the fundamental question: what is the purpose of education?When the time is right we, the profession, the experts, must start formulating the answer. We must be ready to enter a new reality of an education system that values the professional judgment of teachers and leaders.We cannot continue to have a system that has nearly 3,000 children with special educational needs and disabilities lacking a permanent school place. We cannot continue to have an exam system that leaves a third of pupils labelled as failures.The use of education as an ideological and political football that fails the most vulnerable must end. We cannot continue with a toxic exam system that is based on rote learning and an out-of-date curriculum chosen by whoever happens to be the education secretary, and an exam system that has been responsible for a dramatic rise in child and adolescent mental health illness.We have got to stop the testing hamster wheel that burns out children. We cannot continue to allow 16-year-olds to sit 33 hours of GCSE exams, when education and training continues to age 18 and beyond.We must end the fixation with A-levels as the “gold standard”, just because they’ve been around a long time. Our education system must recognise the achievements of all and must not continue to label those who take a vocational education route as less worthy or less valuable, or their qualifications less rigorous.We must end the education “market” and the game playing, end the practice of schools competing against each other for pupils, results and league table places.We cannot and will not continue to be terrorised by Ofsted, an overbearing accountability system that ends the careers of school leaders and teachers, discourages professional collaboration, drives up stress levels and disadvantages those working in the most deprived areas.This pandemic is going to hurt those most at risk: those in precarious employment, those in rented accommodation and all those who, just weeks ago, the government labelled as unskilled – the essential workers in schools, shops, hospitality, social care, delivery and communications, cleaners, caretakers, the armed forces, police, fire, ambulance and the NHS.If we don’t recognise now the vital importance of an inclusive education system and the positive impact it can have on developing a fairer society, then, I fear, we never will. We must use the situation we are faced with now to end child poverty and inequalities in education and the wider society.Niamh Sweeney is a teacher of health and social care and criminology at Cambridge Sixth Form College"

With the spread of the pandemic, calls for action to prevent impending medical catastrophe have become shriller. In Aegean islands on the frontline of the crisis, health carers speak of days gained, not won.But an outbreak of the disease in two facilities near Athens has intensified concerns over the estimated 36,000 men, women and children stranded on remote isles opposite the Turkish coast.Installations on Lesbos, Samos, Chios, Leros and Kos – at six times over capacity, sprawling, wretched and congested – where social distancing, and other precautionary measures are an impossible privilege, offer fertile ground for Covid-19.“Time is on nobody’s side,” said Dutch physician Steven van de Vijver, the driving force behind an online petition urging EU leaders to bring refugees to safety by agreeing to take them in from Greece. Since its launch last week, more than 6,000 European doctors have signed the appeal.“It’s going to require superhuman force and a lot of luck now to stop this potentially lethal virus penetrating island camps,” he said. “At this point, I would say it’s almost impossible that it won’t happen.”After two weeks working in Moria, the squalid and notoriously overpopulated holding facility on Lesbos, De Vijver realised it was an illusion to think that, in such conditions, Covid-19 could be kept under control.“It would be a miracle and it’s dangerous to expect miracles to happen. Coronavirus doesn’t respect borders or barbed wire. People, camp workers, go in and out all the time, and with them the risk of the virus,” he said.It would be a miracle to stop the virus entering the camps and it's dangerous to expect miracles to happenGreek authorities recognise that they are in a race against the clock. Detection of the disease in camps in Malakasa and Ritsona – among 30 refugee facilities on the mainland – has put them in uncharted territory. Malakasa was placed in quarantine on Sunday, hours after an Afghan refugee began displaying symptoms of the virus; Ritsona, 75km north-east of the capital, was sealed off after 23 African asylum seekers tested positive on Thursday.Speaking to the Guardian after ordering the first lockdown, Manos Logothetis, the migration ministry’s general secretary in charge of asylum seekers’ reception, said: “It’s the first case of coronavirus in a reception centre and, yes, we are testing our responses. We’ve quarantined the entire area and taken steps to isolate those with the virus. It’s not been easy, there’ve been protests.“Food has been brought by the International Organization for Migration, which is running the site, along with translators and cultural mediators. Testing will continue.”The outbreak was traced to a 19-year-old Cameroonian woman found to be infected after giving birth in an Athens hospital.“All the rest who have tested positive are asymptomatic,” said Logothetis, a doctor himself. “I found that surprising, but as in all the camps Ritsona’s population is young. Most are under the age of 40 which is why we believe they’ll be able to ride this out.”However, many disagree. A surge in migrants from Turkey, even before the epidemic arrived in Europe, had increased concerns over the cramped and unsanitary conditions of reception centres in Greece.Increasingly, NGOs have voiced fears over lack of access to testing, medical facilities and basic services, including water stations and taps. Calls for the evacuation of refugees to other EU countries have also soared amid evidence of the devastating effect coronavirus is likely to have on an already vulnerable population.Holding facilities on the mainland are generally managed better; refugees are accommodated in containers and pre-fab houses, in stark contrast to the tent cities on the Aegean isles that have long borne the brunt of the migrant and refugee crisis.“It is not a matter of ‘if’ but ‘when’ coronavirus strikes the camps,” said Sanne van der Kooij, a Dutch gynaecologist who has similarly volunteered in Moria multiple times. “I do not have a good feeling. I was last in Lesbos in February and worked at the local hospital where pregnant refugee women are moved to give birth. There were only six ICU beds and the care was very poor. The bed linens were filthy and the Greek doctors and nurses were clearly overwhelmed by the extra work.”Although so far confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported only among local people on Lesbos, refugees requiring emergency medical help run the risk of contracting the virus, she said. “In the hospital for example. That’s where so many will be at threat of coronavirus infection. And then the spread inside [the facility] will be very difficult to stop.”Most asylum seekers in the island camps are from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Unable to leave because of a containment policy determined by the EU, they have found themselves in limbo, trapped on the outposts opposite the Turkish coast until their asylum requests are processed.Almost 35,000 European health workers and other citizens have also backed the doctors’ petition calling on EU governments to comply with an accord struck with Turkey in 2016 under which each member state agreed to take in a fixed number of refugees. Although it is central to a pact aimed at curbing migratory flows, the resettlement pledge was never fulfilled.Greece has, so far, had relative success in keeping transmission of the disease under control, announcing fewer than 2,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and a death toll of 76.But health officials warn that the coming weeks are critical.“The EU will have blood on its hands if it continues to look away,” warned De Vijver, speaking from Amsterdam where most of his patients in the city’s main hospital are now suffering from coronavirus.“There are 22,000 people in Moria: men, women and children all packed into an area that is a fraction of the size of Hyde Park. Scabies, pneumonia, diarrhoea are rife,” he said, adding that conditions had deteriorated markedly since NGOs and volunteer medics had left the island following violent attacks by far-right vigilantes last month.“I was astounded to see that this terrible situation had caused 80% of the complaints we were dealing with. Politicians in the EU have a moral obligation to take these people in,” he said.Greece’s centre-right government has described the camps as “ticking health bombs”.So far this year about 10,000 asylum seekers have been moved from the islands to the mainland – including 1,785 to closed, pre-deportation centres – according to the UN refugee agency. Plans are afoot to transfer another 600 people – 300 elderly refugees and their dependents – to hotels in Athens. Reflecting restrictive measures enforced across Greece to combat Covid-19, authorities have allowed ATMs to be installed in the island facilities, as part of a wider lockdown on the camps.But Logothetis accepts that in the event of a “mass coronavirus outbreak”, health officials on Lesbos would be hard pushed to cope. “In an ideal world we would rent a big venue, keep it warm and kit it out with beds. That I hope will be the next phase of our emergency operational plan because with so few ICUs on the island we don’t have the capacity to withstand the pressure if a lot of people were to get sick at the same time.”The pandemic has effectively stopped any prospect of voluntary returns of migrants under a EU-funded scheme announced last month. Citing coronavirus concerns, the asylum service is also sputtering. Though operational again following Athens’ suspension of applications in response to Turkey’s abrupt decision to relax border controls and allow refugees to head to Europe, the service is not receiving new requests.Hopes of resettling around 1,600 unaccompanied children to other parts of Europe have also dwindled. Officials say member states now want additional health checks, “which will take time”.With the spectre of gridlock, Athens has come under increased pressure from the EU to relocate asylum seekers to the mainland. But that, says Greece’s migration minister Notis Mitarachi, is practically impossible without adequate accommodation.Addressing the EU parliament’s home affairs committee as police moved to lock down Ritsona, he reiterated what prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said repeatedly: Europe should do more to help because Greece “cannot resolve this crisis instantly and alone”.It is a refrain echoed by Logothetis. “We need support and we need to share the burden,” he said. “If each of the other 26 EU member states agreed to take in 2,000 people, our problem would be more than settled. I’d be able to empty the islands in a day.”"

The crisis has rushed the issue to the fore, with growing reports of older and disabled people being earmarked automatically for palliative care only, should they contract Covid-19.To Macaskill, the emergency represents the biggest human-rights challenge since the second world war. “I have never been, nor would I want to be, in a situation where I needed to make that life-or-death decision,” he says. “But if I was, what I would want is very clear guidance so I knew that somebody had my back. What concerns me is that some of the guidance already beginning to appear around the country is misplaced, immoral and illegal.”Politicians – with one or two glorious exceptions – have been remarkably quiet around all thisAdvice for doctors published last week by the British Medical Association says that patient age, “where clinically relevant”, could be a factor in predicting survival in decisions about extending or withholding more intensive treatment, including access to ventilators to support breathing.“Age cannot be the sole proxy [for worth], indeed it should not be the primary proxy,” says Macaskill. “There are many active people in their 70s who would have more beneficial clinical outcomes than, say, somebody in their 50s living with multiple co-morbidities.”The extent of any underlying chronic health conditions, as well as frailty “should have greater significance than simply age when you have that hellish decision to make”, he adds.Macaskill is calling for an immediate initiative to draw up agreed national guidance, with a process involving not just acute-care doctors and ethicists but also geriatricians, gerontologists and social-care leaders. He believes it could be completed, virtually, within 48 hours. But he says the leadership of politicians would be crucial.“We should not be leaving this to the clinicians. Critically, they are the ones who are going to have to make and action the heavy choices. We need greater political intervention in the debate and politicians – with one or two glorious exceptions – have been remarkably quiet around all this.”At Scottish Care, Macaskill – who has a background in further and higher education and faith studies – seeks to apply a human-rights test to all policies and practice. He says he is dismayed by those who wish to scrap the Human Rights Act and dilute the UK’s commitment to the European convention on human rights. “It’s a historical failure to realise where the modern system of human rights came from, which inescapably was the horrors of the second world war.”Since the coronavirus crisis broke, Macaskill has attracted attention not only for his forceful stance on older people’s right to life, but also for taking on the leading supermarket chains for not giving social-care workers the same access to protected shopping time that they have made available to NHS staff.“We have staff coming off 12-hour shifts, struggling to get into the local Tesco because at that very time it’s the shopping hour for the NHS,” he says. Smaller care homes that have always shopped locally for supplies, supporting their high street, have also found themselves unable to get what they need. “They have tried to do the right thing, rather than buy from big multinational chains, and it’s come back to bite them.”Does he think the health and care sector can withstand the crisis? Scotland, he believes, is slightly better placed than the rest of the UK thanks to its relatively small size, greater past investment – with social-care pay higher and vacancy rates lower than in England – and earlier planning for the emergency.But coronavirus is already in what he terms “a good number” of care homes, including Burlington Court in Glasgow where 16 deaths in just over a week have been linked to the disease. “People are frightened that this virus will strike the most vulnerable and strike in the heart of their care home communities,” he says.He thinks availability of personal protection equipment (PPE) has so far been better than in England, owing to a coordinated distribution model across social care and the NHS. But the picture remains far from ideal, he stresses, and following reports at the weekend of the death of a care worker in West Dumbartonshire he tweeted: “This is truly tragic. We must make sure frontline care workers have all the PPE they need.”Macaskill warns that health and care will get through only if social care is treated on a par with the health service when it comes to such issues as PPE distribution. “What I am very clear on is that if social care remains the handmaiden of the NHS, rather than being seen as an equal sister, then we will not achieve the positive outcomes we all want to see,” he says. “Social care has to be valued in its own right because it is critical to us beating the virus in the community generally, but in care homes in particular.”The increasingly traumatic events of the past few weeks have helped social care belatedly start to earn proper recognition in policy circles, he thinks. But he fears there remains “a huge distance to travel” in winning it equal status with the NHS in the public mind.“This crisis will certainly help that,” Macaskill says. “But will it completely change things?

 World must combat looming debt meltdown in developing countries ","As it spread from one country to another, the coronavirus paid no attention to national frontiers or “big, beautiful” border walls. Nor were the ensuing economic effects contained. As has been obvious since the outset, the Covid-19 pandemic is a global problem that demands a global solution.In the world’s advanced economies, compassion should be sufficient motivation to support a multilateral response. But global action is also a matter of self-interest. As long as the pandemic is still raging anywhere, it will pose a threat – both epidemiological and economic – everywhere.The impact of Covid-19 on developing and emerging economies has only begun to reveal itself. There are good reasons to believe that these countries will be ravaged far more by the pandemic than the advanced economies have been. After all, people in lower-income countries tend to live in closer proximity to one another. A higher share of the population suffers from pre-existing health problems that render them more vulnerable to the disease. And these countries’ health systems are even less prepared to manage an epidemic than those of the advanced economies (which have hardly functioned smoothly).A 30 March report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development offers an early glimpse of what lies in store for emerging and developing economies. The most successful of them rely on export-led growth, which will now collapse as the global economy contracts. Not surprisingly, global investment flows are also plummeting, as are commodity prices, indicating a tough road ahead for natural-resource exporters.These developments are already being reflected in the yield spreads on developing countries’ sovereign debt. Many governments will find it exceedingly difficult to roll over the debts coming due this year on reasonable terms, if at all.Moreover, developing countries have fewer and harder choices about how to confront the pandemic. When people are living hand to mouth in the absence of adequate social protections, a loss of income could mean starvation. Yet these countries cannot replicate the US response, which features (so far) a $2tn economic package that will blow up the fiscal deficit by some 10% of GDP (on top of a pre-pandemic deficit of 5%).Following a virtual emergency summit on 26 March, G20 leaders issued a communique committing “to do whatever it takes and to use all available policy tools to minimise the economic and social damage from the pandemic, restore global growth, maintain market stability and strengthen resilience”. To that end, at least two things can be done about the dire state of affairs in emerging and developing economies.First, full use must be made of the International Monetary Fund’s special drawing rights, a form of “global money” that the institution was authorised to create at its founding. The SDR is an essential ingredient in the international monetary order that John Maynard Keynes advocated during the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944. The idea is that, because all countries will obviously want to protect their own citizens and economies during crises, the international community should have a tool for assisting the neediest countries without requiring national budgets to take a hit.A standard SDR issuance – with some 40% of the SDRs going to developing and emerging economies – would make an enormous difference. But it would be even better if advanced economies such as the US donated or lent (on concessionary terms) their SDRs to a trust fund dedicated to helping poorer countries. One might expect that the countries providing this assistance would attach conditions, in particular, that the money not go to bailing out creditors.It is also crucial that creditor countries help by announcing a stay on developing and emerging economies’ debt service. To understand why this is so important, consider the US economy. Last month the US Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that there would be no foreclosures on federally insured mortgages for 60 days. In essence, this policy is part of a broader “stay” on the entire US economy as a response to the Covid-19 crisis. Workers are staying home, restaurants are staying closed and airlines are all but shut down. Why should creditors be allowed to continue racking up returns, especially when the interest rates they charge should have already created a sufficient risk cushion? Unless creditors grant such a stay, many debtors will emerge from the crisis owing more than they can possibly repay.Such stays are just as important internationally as they are domestically. Under current conditions, many countries simply cannot service their debts, which, in the absence of a global stay on repayment, could lead to massive, rolling defaults. In many developing and emerging economies, the government’s only choice is either to funnel more income to foreign creditors or allow more of its citizens to die. Obviously, the latter will be unacceptable to most countries, so the real choice for the international community, then, is between an orderly or a disorderly stay, with the latter scenario inevitably resulting in severe turbulence and far-reaching costs to the global economy.Of course, it would be even better if we had an institutionalised mechanism for restructuring sovereign debt. The international community tried to achieve that in 2015, when the United Nations general assembly adopted a set of shared principles with overwhelming support. Unfortunately, that framework lacked the necessary buy-in from key creditor countries. It is probably too late to establish such a system now for use in the current crisis. But there will inevitably be more crises down the line, which means that sovereign-debt restructuring should be high on the agenda for the post-pandemic reckoning.In John Donne’s immortal words, “No man is an island … ” Nor is any country – as the Covid-19 crisis has made abundantly clear. If only the international community would get its head out of the sand.• Joseph E Stiglitz is a Nobel laureate in economics, university professor at Columbia University and chief economist at the Roosevelt Institute.Ⓒ Project Syndicate"
"36","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/what-happens-to-lungs-coronavirus-covid-19","2020-04-07T01:48:58-0400","  What happens to people's lungs when they get coronavirus? ","What became known as Covid-19, or the coronavirus, started in late 2019 as a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause. The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus – severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19.Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms.WHO says about 80% of people with Covid-19 recover without needing any specialist treatment. Only about one person in six becomes seriously ill “and develops difficulty breathing”.So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body?Guardian Australia spoke with Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician.He says almost all serious consequences of Covid-19 feature pneumonia.Wilson says people who catch Covid-19 can be placed into four broad categories.The least serious are those people who are “sub-clinical” and who have the virus but have no symptoms.Next are those who get an infection in the upper respiratory tract, which, Wilson says, “means a person has a fever and a cough and maybe milder symptoms like headache or conjunctivitis”.He says: “Those people with minor symptoms are still able to transmit the virus but may not be aware of it.”The largest group of those who would be positive for Covid-19, and the people most likely to present to hospitals and surgeries, are those who develop the same flu-like symptoms that would usually keep them off work.A fourth group, Wilson says, will develop severe illness that features pneumonia.He says: “In Wuhan, it worked out that from those who had tested positive and had sought medical help, roughly 6% had a severe illness.”The WHO says the elderly and people with underlying problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.When people with Covid-19 develop a cough and fever, Wilson says this is a result of the infection reaching the respiratory tree – the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside.He says: “The lining of the respiratory tree becomes injured, causing inflammation. This in turn irritates the nerves in the lining of the airway. Just a speck of dust can stimulate a cough.“But if this gets worse, it goes past just the lining of the airway and goes to the gas exchange units, which are at the end of the air passages.“If they become infected they respond by pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacs that are at the bottom of our lungs.”If the air sacs then become inflamed, Wilson says this causes an “outpouring of inflammatory material [fluid and inflammatory cells] into the lungs and we end up with pneumonia.”He says lungs that become filled with inflammatory material are unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, reducing the body’s ability to take on oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.“That’s the usual cause of death with severe pneumonia,” he says.Prof Christine Jenkins, chair of Lung Foundation Australia and a leading respiratory physician, told Guardian Australia: “Unfortunately, so far we don’t have anything that can stop people getting Covid-19 pneumonia.“People are already trialling all sorts of medications and we’re hopeful that we might discover that there are various combinations of viral and anti-viral medications that could be effective. At the moment there isn’t any established treatment apart from supportive treatment, which is what we give people in intensive care.“We ventilate them and maintain high oxygen levels until their lungs are able to function in a normal way again as they recover.”Wilson says patients with viral pneumonia are also at risk of developing secondary infections, so they would also be treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics.“In some situations that isn’t enough,” he says of the current outbreak. “The pneumonia went unabated and the patients did not survive.”Jenkins says Covid-19 pneumonia is different from the most common cases that people are admitted to hospitals for.“Most types of pneumonia that we know of and that we admit people to hospital for are bacterial and they respond to an antibiotic.Wilson says there is evidence that pneumonia caused by Covid-19 may be particularly severe. Wilson says cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect all of the lungs, instead of just small parts.He says: “Once we have an infection in the lung and, if it involves the air sacs, then the body’s response is first to try and destroy [the virus] and limit its replication.”But Wilson says this “first responder mechanism” can be impaired in some groups, including people with underlying heart and lung conditions, diabetes and the elderly.Jenkins says that, generally, people aged 65 and over are at risk of getting pneumonia, as well as people with medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or a chronic disease affecting the lungs, heart, kidney or liver, smokers, Indigenous Australians, and infants aged 12 months and under.“Age is the major predictor of risk of death from pneumonia. Pneumonia is always serious for an older person and in fact it used to be one of the main causes of death in the elderly. Now we have very good treatments for pneumonia.“It’s important to remember that no matter how healthy and active you are, your risk for getting pneumonia increases with age. This is because our immune system naturally weakens with age, making it harder for our bodies to fight off infections and diseases.”Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

With broadcasters and politicians addressing the nation from their own front rooms, it has become easier than ever. Now we don’t even have to go to someone’s home (fortunate in these times) to judge them by their reading habits. Now the libraries of the famous are laid bare for us all to mock or admire.What does it tell us about Boris Johnson, for example, that he has a collection of big, gold-lettered, red-spined hardbacks that look as if they’ve come straight from the fabled library of Alexandria? Or that Prince Charles keeps a hefty Dick Francis close at hand? MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt and the Washington Post’s White House reporter Seung Min Kim both arrange their books by colour, it seems. Joe Wicks has beautiful shelves with … no books on them. And a screenshot of the “first ever digital cabinet”, shared by the PM, suggests that Jacob Rees-Mogg has one of those dream libraries with dark wood shelves and ladders on wheels.Of course, broadcasters know that bookshelves say a lot about a person, and some have been cheating. Fox News correspondent Brandi Kruse, for example, tweeted: “Reporters, experts, pundits working from home in front of bookshelves: what is ONE book you removed from your shelf because you didn’t want people to see it. Don’t lie you, know you did. Mine: 365 Ways to Drive a Liberal Crazy (no memory of how it came to be in my possession).” Cynical viewers will obviously allege that some people have deliberately scratched together a pile of books to pose against, while book lovers assume it would be impossible to find a camera angle in any reasonable person’s home that doesn’t reveal a healthy lockdown reading pile.Here are some of the most interesting bookshelves in the homes of the commentariat.

Snow’s bottom shelf is clearly the art section, with books about Andy Warhol, Aubrey Beardsley, Aristide Maillol, Brâncuşi, Caravaggio and Utagawa Kuniyoshi. There’s an eclectic music shelf, including Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley by Timothy White and Gil Scott-Heron’s memoir The Last Holiday. But Snow is also perhaps following advice to keep healthy and exercise the brain, with Treasures of British History – by his cousin Peter and his son Dan Snow – and The Clever Guts Diet Recipe Book by Dr Clare Bailey.Sad that Dominic Raab cannot afford bookshelves, and is forced to place small stacks of politically relevant books either side of his head in a way that looks really inconvenient in terms of opening those blinds. pic.twitter.com/K8MUp9DPEoDominic RaabThe foreign secretary, on the other hand, appears to have hastily assembled a book collection shortly before appearing on BBC News. Standing in front of a windowsill, he posed with a pile of brand-new-looking books on either side of his head. They included biographies of Richard Nixon and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a book about economics from the Economist, and Niall Ferguson’s Virtual History, which asks questions such as: “What if Britain had stayed out of the first world war? What if Germany had won the second?” What if Raab had already read that book on economics before we got into this mess, we all wondered.Kate Middleton“Kate Middleton shows off her incredible book collection in rare picture taken inside her Kensington Palace home,” promised Hello! magazine in a headline guaranteed to excite nosy book lovers. Alas, the photos showed the Duchess of Cambridge with a row of elegant clothbound Penguin Classics that are beautiful, if not as special as “incredible” might suggest. The Duchess is said to enjoy contemporary thrillers such as The Girl on the Train, but this collection is much more canonical. It includes Sense and Sensibility and Mansfield Park by Jane Austen, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde and Middlemarch by George Eliot.📚 I do like @Beathhigh - but just to prove there’s no favouritism when it comes to brilliant Scottish writers 😂...there’s lots of @valmcdermid @cbrookmyre Ali Smith, Iain Banks, Muriel Spark etc too. @BookWeekScot #ridge https://t.co/2DiFOP8Azt pic.twitter.com/U9d6lKzZGyNicola SturgeonA lockdown is always a good time for a conspiracy theory, and Sturgeon’s bookshelves inspired a great one. The Scottish first minister is known to be a book lover, and her collection shows that she is a loyal supporter of Scottish writers. But why, some asked, were her shelves almost entirely full of Ian Rankins in one interview, and then packed with Val McDermids in another on the same day? Was it something Rankin had said about independence that prompted a cull? Probably not; a closer look shows that Sturgeon had just shuffled her chair one bookcase along.Working from home and wishing @BorisJohnson and @MattHancock a speedy recovery. #StayHomeSaveLives pic.twitter.com/i3WuABOE4pRishi SunakDishy Rishi can’t seem to put a foot wrong at the moment, starting with his “kiss of life” budget and climaxing with this working-from-home photo.

The move comes after several major regions saw a sharp rise in coronavirus cases, especially in the capital Tokyo.The governors of New York and New Jersey pointed to tentative signs on Monday that the coronavirus outbreak was starting to plateau but warned against complacency as the nationwide death toll approached 11,000 in the US, with more than 366,000 confirmed cases.Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison has told citizens to stay home for Easter, as data showed the country’s infection curve was being bent in the right direction. The country has 5,844 cases and 45 deaths from the virus. But the rate of increase in daily cases has dropped over the last week.The country reported a fourth consecutive drop in the number of coronavirus-related deaths on Monday, with 637 dead over the past 24 hours, the lowest number in nearly two weeks.Dr David Clark, the country’s health minister, has been demoted for flouting the country’s strict lockdown rules, after he revealed he had driven 20km with his family to go to the beach. This follows an incident last week in which Clark apologised for driving 2km from his home to go mountain biking. Clark again apologised for being “an idiot” and offered his resignation. He retains the health ministry for now, but has been demoted within Cabinet."

 Your money or your life? Coronavirus has sparked the latest culture war ","Unity has not lasted long – and the rebellion is breaking out from the right. What started as carping about police officiousness is grumbling its way to deep dissent on the entire coronavirus lockdown policy. Reported conflict between Matt Hancock at Health and Rishi Sunak at the Treasury on its costs and benefits leak into the rightwing press in what begins to be a profound culture war – your money or your life.It rises up in the Mail, Times and Telegraph. Here’s Jonathan Sumption taking up the cudgels in the Sunday Times: “As soon as scientists start talking about a month, or even three or six months, we are entering a realm of sinister fantasy in which the cure has taken over as the biggest threat to our society … Generations to come are being saddled with high levels of public and private debt. These things kill too.” The Mail on Sunday promotes critics who would let the virus rip: “Professor Graham Medley, the government’s chief pandemic modeller, said the only viable path through the health emergency would be to let people become infected so they are no longer vulnerable … Mounting unemployment, domestic violence and burgeoning mental health issues could be widespread if the normal functioning of society remains paralysed, Prof Medley forecast.” Social democratic Sweden has become the unlikely beacon of the right’s hope, as the country refuses to lock down. Fraser Nelson writes in the Telegraph: “To Swedes, it’s the rest of the world engaging in a reckless experiment.” The conservative Swedish economist and Brussels thinktank chief Fredrik Erixon rails against the lockdown in the Spectator, quoting Orwell on self-censorship and the threat of totalitarianism. As Swedish corona cases rise they too may swerve, though if they stayed as they are they would act as the world’s control.This attitude has spread from the usual rightwing exhibitionists and contrarians into comments by those such as Luke Johnson, chair of Risk Capital Partners and the Institute of Cancer Research. In the Sunday Times he says that with “an exaggerated fear of falling ill from coronavirus and dying – we have idled the nation and all become hypochondriacs”. He fears for the moral fibre of the nation: “The shutdown is helping to erode the work ethic of a generation.”Expect this low rumble to build into a libertarian crescendo, despite polls showing the country massively in favour of life-saving isolation, with the Queen catching the national mood. The opposition questions the delays, dithering, disastrous lack of testing and the austerity-stricken unpreparedness of the public sector – but crucially not the lockdown itself. When it’s all over, when costs have been reckoned against deaths and the long-term social and economic damage assessed, we may know who was right, though with life-and-death stakes in this cultural rift, we cannot expect either side to admit defeat.Before going to hospital, Boris Johnson asserted he had “a scientifically led, step by step action plan”. He didn’t, he has zigzagged, but at least that sounds sensible. Yet it’s hard to follow “the science” when epidemiologists fall out. Who’s right on the numbers and death toll, the Imperial College London alarmist or the Oxford University moderate? We do have a baseline for acceptable UK flu deaths: there was no outcry over the winter 2014-15 flu toll of 28,189. Any wise government would have been petrified by Imperial’s worst case warning of 510,000 dead if no action was taken. Now watch each side pick their scientists to suit their own cast of mind.On the great question, the public wants no price put on lives: if asked, they want every cancer drug at any price even if it delays death for just a few months. People prefer everyday political decisions weighing life against money to be done through a glass darkly. Less money for the homeless, social care, poor families or maternity services leads directly to deaths, as has been forensically measured by Michael Marmot of the Institute of Health Equity. Poverty kills, infant deaths are rising for the first time in decades, and poorer women are dying younger – though that never worries the right. This economic shutdown will kill and harm: the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation show that the youngest, lowest paid and women will be most damaged. Cancer Research UK’s chief clinician, Professor Charles Swanton, warns that curable cancers will become inoperable as treatments stop. There is no avoiding trade-offs, though they can always be hidden. Casting off the lives of the old to save young futures looks brutal – but for the poorest old, lack of social care and day centres already curtails lives.It is not just in a crisis that healthcare is rationed. Labour set up the admirable National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) to make that explicit: in treatment costs, one quality-adjusted life year (a qaly) is worth £30,000. Professor Gill Leng, the institute’s new head, was asked to produce rapid Covid-19 guidelines but, uniquely, “we were advised cost was not an issue”, she says. “Only what’s best for the service.” For adult critical care, Nice’s algorithm uses the clinical frailty scale, “a holistic approach”. Dementia is rightly included as an adverse frailty in the score card. Will Nice ever evaluate in qalys whether the losses from a stricken economy were worth the gains in life years saved in the lockdown? That all depends, Leng says, on the quality of the data: she hopes someone is trying to evaluate it. For now, “the key question is exit, how do we get out of this?” Testing is vital, but she opposes releasing the lucky ones who are immune first. “In the end only solidarity, all in this together, will see us through.”How odd that it’s the usually “patriotic” voices, the “blitz spirit” nostalgists on the right who are first to break that solidarity.• Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"
"42","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/how-false-claims-about-5g-health-risks-spread-into-the-mainstream","2020-04-07T01:00:17-0400","  How false claims about 5G health risks spread into the mainstream ","A year ago, hoax theories about the dangers of 5G had barely pierced the public’s consciousness, largely remaining confined to serious conspiracy theorists such as David Icke.In recent weeks, baseless claims about risks associated with the next-generation mobile technology have gone mainstream. Claims linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic have led to petrol bomb attacks on phone masts and rebuttals from the government.Industry insiders and factchecking experts point to a perfect storm of conditions that have helped the theory – described as “dangerous nonsense” – to take hold.They cite the rapid growth of neighbourhood social media groups, a failure by networks to promote scientific evidence about 5G, and a terrified population looking to make sense of a world turned upside down.The government and mobile networks have been left scrambling as the some members of the public have turned on telecoms engineers and carried out arson attacks on masts that in many cases do not yet have 5G equipment, as the rollout has been so slow.Tom Phillips, the editor of the factchecking organisation Full Fact, said it warned last summer about the growing prevalence of 5G health claims. But in recent weeks debunked claims about 5G had been transformed, potentially aided by the creation of new local Facebook and WhatsApp groups to help support neighbours during the pandemic. Google Trends data suggests British interest in 5G theories exploded in the final days of March, shortly after the lockdown was imposed.Phillips said one of the difficulties in battling the various claims was that it is hard to pin down exactly what is being suggested. “We’ve seen theories that the virus is real but 5G is making it worse, we’ve seen theories that the symptoms are not the result of the virus but purely the result of 5G, and we’ve seen theories that there are no outbreaks at all but it’s all a hoax to cover up the installation of 5G,” he said.A senior member of staff at one UK mobile network blamed the rapid spread of a map that purported to show an overlap between countries that had coronavirus cases and countries that had rolled out 5G. The map was not accurate on either measure.Other viral claims emphasised other supposed coincidences. A popular claim that Wuhan was the first city in the world to receive 5G took hold. But Wuhan received 5G coverage in August 2019, almost 18 months after O2 launched its first London testbed for the technology on the Greenwich peninsula. Iran, meanwhile, has seen an incredibly high number of coronavirus cases despite not having any 5G coverage.The International Commission on Non‐Ionizing Radiation Protection, which sets guidelines on the output of mobile masts, says there is not a single scientifically substantiated adverse health effect that can be attributed to a normal 5G installation.“We know parts of the community are concerned about the safety of 5G,” Dr Eric van Rongen, the chair of the ICNIRP, told the Guardian. “The guidelines have been developed after a thorough review of all relevant scientific literature, scientific workshops and an extensive public consultation process.”As social media interest in the topic grew, some less scrupulous news outlets latched on to it as a potential source of clicks. The press regulation campaign group Hacked Off has noted that the Daily Star published an article on 24 March – the day after Boris Johnson ordered Britons to stay inside – with the headline “Coronavirus: Fears 5G wifi networks could be acting as ‘accelerator’ for disease”. The story, labelled as an exclusive, relied entirely on quotes from non-scientists.Celebrities who often have larger audiences on Twitter and Instagram than many mainstream news outlets also boosted the theory, although some have since backed down. After the Britain’s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden was mocked for tweeting a link to a petition about the theory, her representative told media outlets that she had accidentally shared the link and did not endorse conspiracy theories.Facing pressure from the government and a showdown with ministers, Facebook announced on Monday that it would start to actively remove false claims that linked Covid-19 to 5G and could lead to physical harm. However, its policy on other scientifically unjustified claims about 5G remain unclear.Users on one of the biggest anti-5G Facebook groups in the UK mix pictures of apparently burnt-out mobile phone equipment with anti-vaccine material and baseless claims that coronavirus wards on hospitals are empty. One prominent anti-5G group in Bristol defended itself from critics by adopting the language of those who distrust mainstream media and scientific voices, claiming that rejecting authoritative voices was the only way to find what is really going on.Direct action in the UK against telephone masts is nothing new. When 3G equipment was being installed across the country in the mid-2000s there was similar outbreaks of concern about supposed health risks, with some resorting to direct action. A long-running protest campaign against a mobile phone mast in the North Yorkshire village of Sheriff Hutton, partly on health grounds, culminated in a mysterious incident in 2007 in which concrete was poured into the base station. Similar claims have been made for decades about the impact of microwave ovens and home wifi connections.Yet despite warnings that public fears about 5G were growing before the pandemic, networks did little large-scale outreach work to counter the concerns. “I think as an industry we could have been quicker and clearer about what 5G is,” one network insider said. “As in, it’s basically the same as 4G in terms of how it uses mobile spectrum. We tend to get a bit bogged down on the technology and miss the wider picture.”Tom Phillips, the factchecking journalist, said it was always tough to convince people to change their minds on such topics once they had decided a theory was true. He also said people who believed the theories needed to be treated with compassion. “It is not enough to try and stamp out the poor quality information, you do have to put good information in its place,” he said. “And as soon you try to provide information, you run the risk of becoming part of the conspiracy theory – ‘you would say that, wouldn’t you?’”"
"43","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/what-coronavirus-can-teach-us-about-hope-rebecca-solnit","2020-04-07T01:00:17-0400","The long read  'The impossible has already happened': what coronavirus can teach us about hope ","Disasters begin suddenly and never really end. The future will not, in crucial ways, be anything like the past, even the very recent past of a month or two ago. Our economy, our priorities, our perceptions will not be what they were at the outset of this year. The particulars are startling: companies such as GE and Ford retooling to make ventilators, the scramble for protective gear, once-bustling city streets becoming quiet and empty, the economy in freefall. Things that were supposed to be unstoppable stopped, and things that were supposed to be impossible – extending workers’ rights and benefits, freeing prisoners, moving a few trillion dollars around in the US – have already happened.The word “crisis” means, in medical terms, the crossroads a patient reaches, the point at which she will either take the road to recovery or to death. The word “emergency” comes from “emergence” or “emerge”, as if you were ejected from the familiar and urgently need to reorient. The word “catastrophe” comes from a root meaning a sudden overturning.We have reached a crossroads, we have emerged from what we assumed was normality, things have suddenly overturned. One of our main tasks now – especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing difficulties – is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible.A disaster (which originally meant “ill-starred”, or “under a bad star”) changes the world and our view of it. Our focus shifts, and what matters shifts. What is weak breaks under new pressure, what is strong holds, and what was hidden emerges. Change is not only possible, we are swept away by it. We ourselves change as our priorities shift, as intensified awareness of mortality makes us wake up to our own lives and the preciousness of life. Even our definition of “we” might change as we are separated from schoolmates or co-workers, sharing this new reality with strangers. Our sense of self generally comes from the world around us, and right now, we are finding another version of who we are.As the pandemic upended our lives, people around me worried that they were having trouble focusing and being productive. It was, I suspected, because we were all doing other, more important work. When you’re recovering from an illness, pregnant or young and undergoing a growth spurt, you’re working all the time, especially when it appears you’re doing nothing. Your body is growing, healing, making, transforming and labouring below the threshold of consciousness. As we struggled to learn the science and statistics of this terrible scourge, our psyches were doing something equivalent. We were adjusting to the profound social and economic changes, studying the lessons disasters teach, equipping ourselves for an unanticipated world.The first lesson a disaster teaches is that everything is connected. In fact, disasters, I found while living through a medium-sized one (the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area) and later writing about major ones (including 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in Japan), are crash courses in those connections. At moments of immense change, we see with new clarity the systems – political, economic, social, ecological – in which we are immersed as they change around us. We see what’s strong, what’s weak, what’s corrupt, what matters and what doesn’t.I often think of these times as akin to a spring thaw: it’s as if the pack ice has broken up, the water starts flowing again and boats can move through places they could not during winter. The ice was the arrangement of power relations that we call the status quo – it seems to be stable, and those who benefit from it often insist that it’s unchangeable. Then it changes fast and dramatically, and that can be exhilarating, terrifying, or both.Those who benefit most from the shattered status quo are often more focused on preserving or reestablishing it than protecting human life – as we saw when a chorus of US conservatives and corporate top dogs insisted that, for the sake of the stock market, everyone had to go back to work, and that the resultant deaths would be an acceptable price to pay. In a crisis, the powerful often try to seize more power – as they have in this round, with the Trump Department of Justice looking at suspending constitutional rights – and the rich seek more riches: two Republican senators are under fire for allegedly using inside information about the coming pandemic to make a profit in the stock market (although both have denied wrongdoing).Disaster scholars use the term “elite panic” to describe the ways that elites react when they assume that ordinary people will behave badly. When elites describe “panic” and “looting” in the streets, these are usually misnomers for ordinary people doing what they need to do to survive or care for others. Sometimes it’s wise to move rapidly from danger; sometimes it’s altruistic to gather supplies to share.Such elites often prioritise profit and property over human life and community. In the days after a huge earthquake struck San Francisco on 18 April 1906, the US military swarmed over the city, convinced that ordinary people were a threat and a source of disorder. The mayor issued a “shoot to kill” proclamation against looters, and the soldiers believed they were restoring order. What they were actually doing was setting inexpert firebreaks that helped fire spread through the city, and shooting or beating citizens who disobeyed orders (sometimes those orders were to let the fires burn down their own homes and neighbourhoods). Ninety-nine years later, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans’s police and white vigilantes did the same thing: shooting black people in the name of defending property and their own authority. The local, state and federal government insisted on treating a stranded, mostly poor, mostly black population as dangerous enemies to be contained and controlled, rather than victims of a catastrophe to be aided.The mainstream media colluded in obsessing about looting in the aftermath of Katrina. The stock of mass-manufactured goods in large corporate chain stores seemed to matter more than people needing food and clean water, or grandmothers left clinging to roofs. Nearly 1,500 people died of a disaster that had more to do with bad government than with bad weather. The US Army Corps of Engineers’ levees had failed; the city had no evacuation plans for the poor, and President George W Bush’s administration failed to deliver prompt and effective relief. The same calculus is happening now. A member of the Brazilian opposition said of Brazil’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro: “He represents the most perverse economic interests that couldn’t care less about people’s lives. They’re worried about maintaining their profitability.” (Bolsonaro claims he is trying to protect workers and the economy.)The billionaire evangelist who owns the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby claimed divine guidance in keeping his workers at their jobs when businesses were ordered to close. (The company has now closed all its stores.) At Uline Corporation, owned by billionaire Trump backers Richard and Liz Uihlein, a memo sent to Wisconsin workers said: “please do NOT tell your peers about the symptoms & your assumptions. By doing so, you are causing unnecessary panic in the office.” The billionaire founder and chairman of payroll processing corporation Paychex, Tom Golisano, said: “The damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people.” (Golisano has since said his comments were misrepresented, and has apologised.)Historically, there have always been titans of industry who prized the lifeless thing that is profit over living beings, who paid bribes in order to operate unhindered, worked children to death or put labourers in mortal danger in sweatshops and coal mines. There were also those who pressed on with fossil fuel extraction and burning despite what they knew, or refused to know, about climate change. One of the primary uses of wealth has always been to buy your way out of the common fate, or, at least, it has come with a belief that you can disassociate from society at large. And while the rich are often conservative, conservatives more often align with the rich, whatever their economic status.The idea that everything is connected is an affront to conservatives who cherish a macho every-man-for-himself frontier fantasy. Climate change has been a huge insult to them – this science that says what comes out of our cars and chimneys shapes the fate of the world in the long run and affects crops, sea level, forest fires and so much more. If everything is connected, then the consequences of every choice and act and word have to be examined, which we see as love in action and they see as impingement upon absolute freedom, freedom being another word for absolutely no limits on the pursuit of self-interest. Ultimately, a significant portion of conservatives and corporate leaders regard science as an annoyance that they can refuse to recognise. Some insist they can choose whatever rules and facts they want, as though these too are just free-market commodities to pick and choose from or remake according to one’s whims. “This denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis,” wrote the journalist Katherine Stewart in the New York Times.Our rulers showed little willingness to recognise the ominous possibilities of the pandemic in the US, the UK, Brazil and many other countries. They failed in their most important job, and denying that failure will be a major focus for them. And while it may be inevitable that the pandemic will result in an economic crash, it is also turning into an opportunity for authoritarian power grabs in the Philippines, Hungary, Israel and the US – a reminder that the largest problems are still political, and so are their solutions.When a storm subsides, the air is washed clean of whatever particulate matter has been obscuring the view, and you can often see farther and more sharply than at any other time. When this storm clears, we may, as do people who have survived a serious illness or accident, see where we were and where we should go in a new light. We may feel free to pursue change in ways that seemed impossible while the ice of the status quo was locked up. We may have a profoundly different sense of ourselves, our communities, our systems of production and our future.For many of us in the developed world, what has changed most immediately is spatial. We have stayed home, those of us who have homes, and away from contact with others. We have withdrawn from schools, workplaces, conferences, vacations, gyms, errands, parties, bars, clubs, churches, mosques, synagogues, from the busyness and bustle of everyday life. The philosopher-mystic Simone Weil once wrote to a faraway friend: “Let us love this distance, which is thoroughly woven with friendship, since those who do not love each other are not separated.” We have withdrawn from each other to protect each other. And people have found ways to help the vulnerable, despite the need to remain physically distant.My friend Renato Redentor Constantino, a climate campaigner, wrote to me from the Philippines, and said: “We are witness today to daily displays of love that remind us of the many reasons why humans have survived this long. We encounter epic acts of courage and citizenship each day in our neighbourhoods and in other cities and countries, instances that whisper to us that the depredations of a few will eventually be overcome by legions of stubborn people who refuse the counsel of despair, violence, indifference and arrogance that so-called leaders appear so eager nowadays to trigger.”When we are no longer trying to unlink ourselves from the chain of a spreading disease, I wonder if we will rethink how we were linked, how we moved about and how the goods we rely on moved about. Perhaps we will appreciate the value of direct face-to-face contact more. Perhaps the Europeans who have sung together from their balconies or applauded together for their medical workers, and the Americans who came out to sing or dance on their suburban blocks, will have a different sense of belonging. Perhaps we will find a new respect for the workers who produce our food and those who bring it to our tables.Although staying put is hard, maybe we will be reluctant to resume our rushing about, and something of the stillness now upon us will stay with us. We may rethink the wisdom of having much of our most vital stuff – medicine, medical equipment – made on other continents. We may also rethink the precarious just-in-time supply chains. I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process. A new awareness of how each of us belongs to the whole and depends on it may strengthen the case for meaningful climate action, as we learn that sudden and profound change is possible after all.“Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers,” Wordsworth wrote, a little more than 200 years ago. Perhaps this will be the moment that we recognise that there is enough food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education for all – and that access to these things should not depend on what job you do and whether you earn enough money. Perhaps the pandemic is also making the case, for those who were not already convinced, for universal healthcare and basic income. In the aftermath of disaster, a change of consciousness and priorities are powerful forces.A dozen years ago I interviewed the Nicaraguan poet and Sandinista revolutionary Giocondo Belli for my book on disaster, A Paradise Built in Hell. What she told me about the aftermath of the 1972 earthquake in Managua – that, despite the dictatorship’s crackdown, it helped bring on the revolution – was unforgettable. She said: “You had a sense of what was important. And people realised that what was important was freedom and being able to decide your life and agency. Two days later you had this tyrant imposing a curfew, imposing martial law. The sense of oppression on top of the catastrophe was really unbearable. And once you had realised that your life can be decided by one night of the Earth deciding to shake, [you thought]: ‘So what? I want to live a good life and I want to risk my life, because I can also lose my life in one night.’ You realise that life has to be lived well or is not worth living. It’s a very profound transformation that takes place during catastrophes.”I have found over and over that the proximity of death in shared calamity makes many people more urgently alive, less attached to the small things in life and more committed to the big ones, often including civil society or the common good.I have mostly written about 20th-century disasters, but one analogy a bit further back comes to mind: the Black Death, which wiped out a third of Europe’s population, and, in England, later led to peasant revolts against war taxes and wage caps that were officially quashed, but nevertheless led to more rights and freedoms for peasants and labourers. In the emergency legislation passed in the US in March, many workers gained new sick-leave rights. Lots of things we were assured were impossible – housing the homeless, for example – have come to pass in some places.Ireland nationalised its hospitals, something “we were told would never happen and could never happen,” an Irish journalist commented. Canada came up with four months of basic income for those who lost their jobs. Germany did more than that. Portugal decided to treat immigrants and asylum seekers as full citizens during the pandemic. In the US, we have seen powerful labour agitation, and results. Workers at Whole Foods, Instacart and Amazon have protested at being forced to work in unsafe conditions during the pandemic. (Whole Foods has since offered workers who test positive two weeks off on full pay; Instacart says it has made changes to safeguard workers and shoppers, while Amazon said it is “following guidelines” on safety.) Some workers have gained new rights and raises, including almost half a million Kroger grocery store workers, while 15 state attorneys-general told Amazon to expand its paid sick leave. These specifics make clear how possible it is to change the financial arrangements of all our societies.But often the most significant consequences of disasters are not immediate or direct. The 2008 financial collapse led to 2011’s Occupy Wall Street uprising, which prompted a new reckoning with economic inequality and a new scrutiny of the human impact of exploitative mortgages, student loans, for profit-colleges, health-insurance systems and more, and that in turn amplified the profiles of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose ideas have helped pull the Democratic party to the left, towards policies that will make the US fairer and more equal. The conversations stirred by Occupy and its sister movements across the globe incited more critical scrutiny of ruling powers, and more demands for economic justice. Changes in the public sphere originate within the individual, but also, changes in the world at large affect our sense of self, our priorities and our sense of the possible.We are only in the early stages of this disaster, and we are also in a strange stillness. It is like the Christmas truce of 1914, when German and English soldiers stopped fighting for a day, the guns fell silent and soldiers mingled freely. War itself paused. There’s a way that our getting and spending has been a kind of war against the Earth. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, carbon emissions have plummeted. Reports say the air above Los Angeles, Beijing and New Delhi is miraculously clean. Parks all over the US are shut to visitors, which may have a beneficial effect on wildlife. In the last government shutdown of 2018-2019, elephant seals at Point Reyes National Seashore just north of San Francisco took over a new beach, and now own it for the duration of their season of mating and birthing on land.There’s another analogy that comes to mind. When a caterpillar enters its chrysalis, it dissolves itself, quite literally, into liquid. In this state, what was a caterpillar and will be a butterfly is neither one nor the other, it’s a sort of living soup. Within this living soup are the imaginal cells that will catalyse its transformation into winged maturity. May the best among us, the most visionary, the most inclusive, be the imaginal cells – for now we are in the soup. The outcome of disasters is not foreordained. It’s a conflict, one that takes place while things that were frozen, solid and locked up have become open and fluid – full of both the best and worst possibilities. We are both becalmed and in a state of profound change.But this is also a time of depth for those spending more time at home and more time alone, looking outward at this unanticipated world. We often divide emotions into good and bad, happy and sad, but I think they can equally be divided into shallow and deep, and the pursuit of what is supposed to be happiness is often a flight from depth, from one’s own interior life and the suffering around us – and not being happy is often framed as a failure. But there is meaning as well as pain in sadness, mourning and grief, the emotions born of empathy and solidarity. If you are sad and frightened, it is a sign that you care, that you are connected in spirit. If you are overwhelmed – well, it is overwhelming, and it will take decades of study, analysis, discussion and contemplation to understand how and why 2020 suddenly took us all into marshy new territory.Seven years ago, Patrisse Cullors wrote a sort of mission statement for Black Lives Matter: “Provide hope and inspiration for collective action to build collective power to achieve collective transformation. Rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and dreams.” It is beautiful not only because it is hopeful, not only because then Black Lives Matter set out and did transformative work, but because it acknowledges that hope can coexist with difficulty and suffering. The sadness in the depths and the fury that burns above are not incompatible with hope, because we are complex creatures, because hope is not optimism that everything will be fine regardless.Hope offers us clarity that, amid the uncertainty ahead, there will be conflicts worth joining and the possibility of winning some of them. And one of the things most dangerous to this hope is the lapse into believing that everything was fine before disaster struck, and that all we need to do is return to things as they were. Ordinary life before the pandemic was already a catastrophe of desperation and exclusion for too many human beings, an environmental and climate catastrophe, an obscenity of inequality. It is too soon to know what will emerge from this emergency, but not too soon to start looking for chances to help decide it.

UK charities have estimated they face a £4bn shortfall over three months, with organisations including Cancer Research UK, Barnardo’s and the Children’s Society all warning of significant drops in income.Sue Ryder has lost £2m from its investment fund and £440,000 in monthly retail profits while it is still paying rents on many of its units. The cancellation of the London Marathon, which was due to happen on 26 April, cost it £200,000 in lost fundraising and in total it is facing a £12m shortfall in the next three months. Even before the coronavirus outbreak, the charity was facing financial strains with the proportion of its income from the NHS falling from about 55% in 2012 to 30%.“To close at this time would be crazy,” said Heidi Travis, chief executive of Sue Ryder. “We know we ought to be taking patients from NHS trusts. [The people we look after] would have to go back to the NHS, including the hundreds of people being cared for in the community. At this time it would be ridiculous.”Alongside Marie Curie, the other major provider of hospice care, Hospice Care UK and Together for Short Lives, a children’s charity, Sue Ryder has been calling for a £200m rescue package from the Department of Health and Social Care to see the hospice sector through the next three months.On Sunday, Matt Hancock said he is putting more money into hospices. The health secretary also proposed that Premier League footballers “club together and support our hospices and support the national effort that we’re all in”.But with no announcement on funding yet made, Sue Ryder has now launched a public appeal for funds.“The country will lose its hospices at a time when they are needed most,” said Travis. “This is a plea and no less, we cannot wait any longer. Our doctors and nurses are working night and day to provide end of life care to more people, now and in the coming weeks, than ever before. We are a critical frontline support service in the fight against coronavirus yet we are on the brink of closure.” Carrie-Anne Taitt, 30, a mother of two with incurable cancer receiving care at home in Gloucestershire from Sue Ryder, said the prospect of the charity closing services was “hugely scary”.“The government needs to step in and make sure we are protected and we don’t end up getting more poorly and putting more strain on the NHS,” she said. “Otherwise it is a vicious circle.”She said that the home carers provided by the charity had become “a huge part of my life”, especially now that her children, aged three and six, are not able to go out to school or child care.“If they don’t come, it would be a major stress,” she said. “We desperately, desperately need them.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Palliative and end of life care services, including hospices, play a hugely important role in providing care for thousands at the most difficult time, and last year the prime minister announced a £25m cash injection to protect the crucial service they provide.“We are absolutely committed to keeping hospices open during this time and are working closely with the NHS, Together for Short Lives and Hospice UK on an appropriate national response. We will be setting out our hospice support package shortly.” "
"45","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug","2020-04-07T01:00:16-0400","  Hydroxychloroquine: how an unproven drug became Trump’s coronavirus 'miracle cure' ","This weekend, Donald Trump used his daily White House coronavirus briefings to again urge Americans to take hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that has not been shown to be safe or effective against Covid-19.“What do you have to lose? Take it,” the president said on Saturday as he boasted that the US had amassed 29m doses of the drug. On Sunday, facing questions from the press about his aggressive promotion of an unproven treatment, he argued against waiting for the completion of clinical trials. “In France, they had a very good test,” he said. “But we don’t have time to go and say, ‘Gee, let’s take a couple of years and test it out, and let’s go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories.’”Meanwhile, Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease doctor, has repeatedly warned that there is no conclusive evidence to support using the drug. Asked whether it should be considered a treatment for Covid-19, he said on 24 March: “The answer is no.”The story of how hydroxychloroquine was anointed the Trump administration’s miracle drug for the coronavirus pandemic is a distinctly modern tale of misinformation within a global information ecosystem beset by widespread uncertainty, fear, media fragmentation and hyper-partisanship. Belief in the drug’s potential to cure patients infected with the virus followed an extraordinary trajectory from a small study conducted in France (Trump’s “very good test”) to Silicon Valley social media influencers, Fox News, and the largest bully pulpit: the White House.Epidemics are dangerous to rulersBut it’s also a story as old as medicine itself. When an epidemic killed thousands in ancient Rome, said Aaron Shakow, a research associate at Harvard Medical School and historian of medicine, the chief physician of the emperor Nero circulated a recipe for an old miracle cure.“It was an attempt by Nero to sustain his legitimacy in the midst of this catastrophic event,” Shakow said. “Epidemics are dangerous to rulers.”In early March, as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated its spread around the globe, a group of scientists in Marseilles, France, launched an experiment to see whether hydroxychloroquine, a well-known old malaria drug, could be what everyone was searching for: a cure.Most small scientific studies live and die within the rarified domain of academic journals, but the French trial had a much more auspicious debut. Before the study was even published, in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (IJAA), a lawyer falsely claiming an affiliation with Stanford University appeared on Fox News’s Tucker Carlson Tonight to declare the results: a “100% cure rate against coronavirus”. From Fox News, it was only a matter of time (hours, in fact) before the drug was being hailed as a “game changer” by the president of the United States.Trump made his first endorsement of hydroxychloroquine on 19 March. Export controls, shortages, overdoses, and scientific recriminations rapidly ensued, but the controversy could not extinguish the power of presidentially endorsed hope. Across the globe and throughout diverse communities on the internet, hydroxychloroquine had been anointed the miracle cure for Covid-19.The only problem? The study that all this fervid hope is based on doesn’t show what its authors claim it does.The gold standard for a clinical trial is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). What this means in plain English is that the study has been designed to reduce biases that would render its results meaningless. Neither the physician nor the patients knows whether they received the drug (“double-blinded”), a safeguard that reduces the possibility that the doctor will treat the two groups differently. The researchers also do not get to choose which patients go into which group (“randomized”) and the makeup of the two groups is roughly equivalent (“controlled”).The French hydroxychloroquine study did not follow any of these rules.The treatment group and the control group were drawn from separate populations: the treatment group were all patients at the institution where the researchers worked, the Méditerranée Infection University Hospital Institute in Marseille, while the control patients came from other hospitals in the south of France. The treatment group (mean age 51.2) was significantly older than the control group (mean age 37.3), introducing another variable that could undermine the meaning of the results. The study was “open label”, meaning the physicians and patients knew which treatment they were receiving. The French researchers also treated some but not all of the treatment group patients with azithromycin, a common antibiotic, another complicating factor that was not randomized.But even more important than these shortcomings in the design of the study is how the researchers chose to measure and report their results. Forty-two patients were initially included in the study. Three were transferred to the intensive care unit; one died, one left the hospital, and one stopped taking the treatment due to nausea. The other 36 eventually recovered, and those who received the drug cleared the virus from the system faster than those who did not.If you had only heard about this study from the Fox News assertion of a “100% cure rate”, you might assume that the four patients with poor clinical outcomes (the three ICU visits and one death) had been unlucky enough to be in the group that did not receive the “cure”.And yet, those four patients, as well as the patient with nausea and the one who left the hospital early, were all part of the treatment group. They were excluded from the topline results of the study because of the way that the researchers chose to measure and report the results: strictly based on the measurable presence of viruses in nasal swabs taken each day of the study. Since the patients were in the ICU or dead, their samples could not be taken and they were left out of the final analysis. Based on the nasal swabs of just the 36 patients who completed the study, those who received the drug cleared the virus from their systems faster than those who did not.This is how an experiment in which 15% of the treatment group and 0% of the control had poor clinical outcomes could end up being reported as showing a “100% cure rate”.On 3 April, two weeks after the study was first published online, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the IJAA, said in a statement that the group’s board “believes the article does not meet the Society’s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety”.Didier Raoult, the corresponding author for the French study, did not respond to questions from the Guardian.Andrew Noymer, a professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, described the results of the French study as “meaningless”. “They should have done an RCT,” he said.“This idea that we’re all manning the lifeboats and there’s no time for that is just absurd,” Noymer added. “They could have already done it. They could have had the answer by now … Doctors have always gone with their guts and saved many lives, but I don’t know. If they had done RCTs on Thalidomide” – a drug that caused birth defects – “they would have figured out its dangers a lot sooner.”So how did one interesting but flawed study out of the south of France make its way to Fox News’s prime time and the White House?It was not surprising that scientists were interested in testing hydroxychloroquine (and its close relative, chloroquine), a well-known and understood drug, as a potential treatment against Covid-19. It is one of a number of possible treatments that scientists in China and South Korea looked at in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, including with in vitro (ie lab-based) experiments that showed promising (though not conclusive) results. The drug was also selected as one of four that the World Health Organization included in its large-scale international clinical trial.But while hydroxychloroquine was garnering some interest in the early days of the pandemic, other possible treatments, such as Gilead’s antiviral Remdesivir, were drawing more. Google trends data shows that people were searching for Remdesivir more than hydroxychloroquine throughout most of February.What Remdesivir lacked that hydroxychloroquine had, however, was a team of dedicated hype men who appeared more interested in publicizing the drug as a cure than they were in discovering whether the drug was effective.Among these is Raoult, the French physician who co-authored the hydroxychloroquine study in Marseille. Before Raoult had even begun his clinical trial, in late February, he appeared in the press to promote the idea of chloroquine as a treatment, researchers with First Draft News found. A video of the appearance received more than a quarter-million views on Facebook.Raoult also found a dedicated and effective English-language publicist in Gregory Rigano, the lawyer who appeared on Fox News with a chyron that falsely labeled him an “adviser” to Stanford Medical School. Rigano wrote a Google document promoting the use of chloroquine with James Todaro, a blockchain investor who received a medical degree from Columbia University but does not appear to practice. (The document initially listed a third co-author, a retired biochemist who disclaimed any knowledge of it when contacted by Wired.)The Google document, which was formatted in a way that made it appear to be a scientific paper, found an audience among Silicon Valley’s elite. It was shared on Twitter by a number of influential investors before it hit the virality motherlode: on 16 March, the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted the link to the document to his nearly 33m followers.Maybe worth considering chloroquine for C19 https://t.co/LEYob7Jofr“When someone who is newsworthy or notable that has an enormous network on social media tweets about something that could be as path-breaking as a medicine that could treat coronavirus, everyone is going to pay attention no matter if that person has expertise or not,” said Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change research project at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center. “Elon Musk elevating and giving voice to this Google doc does act as a validating mechanism. Elon Musk is a tech entrepreneur best known as a car salesman, but nevertheless people look to him for what’s new, what’s next.”Musk’s tweet received more than 13,000 retweets. (He did not respond to questions from the Guardian about his promotion of the document.) Search interest in chloroquine soared. Mainstream media outlets covered his apparent endorsement of the drug. An 85-year-old medication was well on its way to becoming a Covid-19 meme.Once Trump declared himself a proponent of hydroxychloroquine, the scientific debate over the drug was drowned out by a decidedly partisan one.Rightwing media outlets have followed Fox News’s lead (an analysis by Media Matters found that the cable news channel promoted using the drug 109 times between 23 March and 25 March) to become staunch proponents of the drug, from digital outrage factories such as the Daily Caller and the Daily Wire to the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal.“These drugs are helping our coronavirus patients,” declared the headline of the Journal op-ed, which was written by two physicians from Kansas, Jeff Colyer and Daniel Hinthorn. The pair wrote that they had been treating patients with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and encouraged others to do so too “as a matter of clinical practice” once a patient tests positive. They also recommended using the drug prophylactically for healthcare workers.The doctors did not provide any data from their own patients, but referenced the French study, writing: “Researchers in France treated a small number of patients with both hydroxychloroquine and a Z-Pak, and 100% of them were cured by day six of treatment.”Hinthorn, the director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Kansas Medical Center, responded to queries from the Guardian about the op-ed’s mischaracterization of the French study: “You are correct. Any patient left out of any analysis makes us suspicious. But what this study told us was that this was a combination that might merit further evaluation.”He acknowledged that it is unknown whether the drug is beneficial or harmful for Covid-19 patients, but said that since no drug has as yet been proven effective, “if there is any medication that might give hope, we prefer to try it” as long as it is safe. “We should know in the next few weeks whether such a regimen was a wise decision or not.”Hinthorn did not respond to a follow up question about whether the op-ed should be corrected to more accurately reflect the degree of uncertainty around hydroxychloroquine. Colyer, the former governor of Kansas and a plastic surgeon, did not respond to requests for comment. He has since written a second op-ed for the Journal, also promoting hydroxychloroquine.The idea that hydroxychloroquine is “the cure” has taken off within certain online communities, including among anti-vaxxers and followers of QAnon, a rightwing conspiracy theory. The drug has also found support from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a small, ultra-conservative organization that advocates against government involvement in medicine. The group launched a texting campaign to bombard physicians with demands to sign a petition against “red tape” that might prevent them from prescribing the drug, Reuters reported.Away from the rancor of the partisan media, scientists and physicians continue to study the effects of the drug. In some states, including the hard-hit New York, hospitals are following Hinthorn’s rationale and using the drug since no proven therapy exists.A group of French researchers published a refutation of the Raoult study in Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses on 30 March. The researchers, at Saint Louis Hospital in France, followed the same regimen of hydroxychloroquine for 11 patients, and did not have similar results. “We found no evidence of a strong antiviral activity or clinical benefit of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of our hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19,” they wrote. “Ongoing randomized clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine should provide a definitive answer regarding the alleged efficacy of this combination and will assess its safety.”But another study – this time a randomized controlled trial – out of Wuhan, China, has sparked hope since it was circulated ahead of publication on 31 March. The trial of 62 patients found that patients with mild cases of Covid-19 who were treated with hydroxychloroquine recovered faster than those who did not – and none of them progressed to “severe” illness. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.The authors of the study urged further research and large-scale clinical trials to better understand how the drug operates and how best to use it.The hype around hydroxychloroquine has not been without casualties.Heightened demand for the drug has left longtime patients – including lupus patients who have long used it as an anti-inflammatory – forced to go without. Overdoses have also been reported in the US and Nigeria as frightened individuals attempt to self-medicate.Social media companies, who have been proactive about policing misinformation about coronavirus, have taken some steps to counter the spread of false claims. Google took down the Google document by Rigano , though the company has not responded to numerous requests for an explanation. Twitter has also deleted tweets by the Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, and the Fox News personality Laura Ingraham that touted the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.When the president of the United States does something, it’s quite the endorsementBut it’s hard to see how these small enforcement actions by internet platforms can have much of an impact when the president of the United States continues to use his platform to promote the drug, as he did during his daily briefings on Saturday and again on Sunday.Trump’s promotion of the drug has raised questions about his motivation, and on Monday the New York Times reported that the president holds “a small personal financial interest” in Sanofi, the company that makes a brandname version of hydroxychloroquine. (The drug’s patent has expired so other pharmaceutical companies can manufacture generic versions.)As a piece of viral misinformation, the hydroxychloroquine meme has amassed an extraordinary list of validators, starting with its placement in a respectable peer-reviewed journal. (Though misinformation stemming from academia is not without precedent; the paper that touched off the false belief in a link between autism and the measles vaccine was published in one of the most respected publications in medicine, and only retracted 12 years later.) It’s also very difficult to refute, because none of the hydroxychloroquine narrative’s critics can or will say anything definitive about its efficacy. Uncertainty and a call to await further study is a weak sword to bring to a fight against an overly confident propagandist.Trump’s unscientific embrace of hydroxychloroquine is not common, but there are historical examples of heads of state spreading misinformation during pandemics. One recent, tragic example is the HIV-denialism of the South African president Thabo Mbeki, who rejected the use of antiretroviral drugs for his country’s citizens and instead promoted nutritional remedies such as beetroot juice and garlic. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health ultimately placed the death toll of Mbeki’s policies at approximately 330,000.Noymer, the UC Irvine epidemiologist, said that the two situations were not quite analogous, since hydroxychloroquine has a “plausible mechanism” to combat the coronavirus, while beetroot juice never did.Still, Noymer said that the influence that a president can have over a population’s attitude toward a medicine or drug is significant. He recalled President Gerald Ford publicly receiving a flu shot in 1976, amid fear that a new swine flu could lead to a pandemic.“There was a photograph of him rolling up a sleeve and getting a shot, and the uptake on the flu shot was enormous,” Noymer said. “When the president of the United States does something, it’s quite the endorsement.”As for Trump, it does not appear likely that he will stop hyping the drug anytime soon, nor that he will take responsibility if anything goes wrong.“What do you have to lose?” he said Sunday. “They say, take it. I’m not looking at it one way or the other … If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn’t do it early. I’ve seen things that I sort of like, so what do I know?“I’m not a doctor.”"

There were also 30 new asymptomatic cases reported.However, for the first time since the commission began publishing its figures in January, there were no new deaths reported.The sliver of promising news came as mainland China and Hong Kong strengthened restrictions on foreign arrivals amid growing number of imported and asymptomatic cases.More than 1.3 million people around the world have been diagnosed with Covid-19, and there have been more than 74,744 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker.Last month, authorities began easing restrictions on the residents of Wuhan, which has endured months of an extraordinary lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.As rates of infection dropped, authorities designated more than 7,000 residential compounds in Wuhan “epidemic-free”, allowing residents to leave their homes for two hours at a time. Travel restrictions were scheduled to lift on Wednesday, allowing people with green health codes to leave the city.But on Monday, state news agency Xinhua said those designations had been revoked for 45 compounds due to the emergence of asymptomatic cases, among other unspecified reasons.Chinese authorities have only recently changed their focus to asymptomatic cases, which until this month were not included in the tally of confirmed infections, despite being an estimated 18-31% of cases, according to Shanghai-based infectious disease doctor Zhang Wenhong.Asymptomatic cases have only been included in the criteria for a residence being “epidemic-free” since 4 April.China has reported a total of 81,740 confirmed cases of Covid-19, including 3,331 who have died, although there is some international scepticism of the government’s transparency with figures.Cases in mainland China have been dropping since March, but it is among several Asian nations facing a second wave of infections brought in from overseas. On Monday the government said it would increase measures at land borders, where the number of cases detected were exceeding those recorded at airports. It also announced it would indefinitely extend its ban on foreigners entering or transiting.Hong Kong, which was considered to have early success in preventing an epidemic, has seen cases more than double in recent weeks, prompting new strict measures on residents too.Chief executive Carrie Lam on Tuesday said there had been double-digit growth in cases every day, mostly among Hong Kong residents returning from overseas.Lam said she wanted the public to exercise self discipline but that the government would not hesitate to use legislation to enforce stricter measures.Other developments included:In Britain, prime minister Boris Johnson was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at St Thomas’ hospital after falling ill with Covid-19. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is Johnson’s “designated survivor”, is running the country’s pandemic response while the prime minister is in hospital.US president Donald Trump was among world leaders to send the best wishes to Johnson, saying intensive care was “really big stuff”, but he also said he had asked two unnamed “leading [pharmaceutical] companies” to contact London and offer “therapeutics” to help Johnson.In Japan, prime minister Shinzo Abe said he expected to declare a state of emergency soon, after several regions, including Tokyo, saw sharp rises in the number of cases.In the US, the governors of New York and New Jersey pointed to tentative signs that the outbreak was starting to plateau, but warned against complacency. More than 10,000 people have died in the US after contracting Covid-19, and more than 350,000 people have been formally diagnosed.In Europe, Spain had its fourth consecutive day of reporting a drop in Covid-19-related deaths. In the past 24 hours 637 people died, which was the lowest number in nearly a fortnight. More than 13,055 people have died in Spain, second only to Italy which has recorded 16,500 fatalities.In New Zealand, the health minister David Clark was demoted after he admitted he drove his family 20km to a beach, against the country’s strict lockdown rules.Additional reporting by Pei Lin Wu"

In 70% of cases, this was due to Covid-19.The disruptions to Australian workers were vast.Almost half of the businesses still trading reported making some sort of change to their workforce in the past two weeks due to Covid-19, including either temporary reductions or increases in work hours, a change of work location, or placing staff on leave.Reduced work hours were reported by 25% of businesses with 19 employees or fewer, 41% of those with 20-199 workers, and 34% of those with 200 or more employees.Nowhere was the impact more apparent than in the hospitality sector.About 78% of accommodation and food services businesses had made changes to their workforce, including 70% that temporarily reduced work hours.About 43% said they had placed staff on unpaid leave, including standing them down, and 29% said they had put staff on paid leave.The sector accounts for about 8% of Australia’s jobs.The numbers, while not unexpected, paint a stark picture of Covid-19’s impact on Australian business.The United Workers Union and its hospitality arm Hospo Voice are campaigning for the government’s Jobkeeper package to be extended to all hospitality workers. Individuals on temporary visas or casuals who have not been with the same employer for 12 months are currently not eligible.“Covid-19 doesn’t discriminate, neither should the government’s Jobkeeper package or any other income support program. It must extend to all workers, no one should be left behind,” Tim Kennedy, national secretary, said.On Monday Westpac economists warned Australian gross domestic product would contract by 8.5% in the June quarter, followed by a 0.6% contraction in the September quarter.“Overall, the economy is expected to contract by 5% through the 2020 year,” Bill Evans, Westpac’s chief economist, said.“All else being equal, these growth forecasts would be consistent with the unemployment rate peaking at 17% in the June quarter and settling around 9% by year’s end.”Westpac economists predicted the impact of Covid-19 would be particularly severe in New South Wales and Victoria, due to their reliance on tourism and international students.NSW was predicted to record its first recession since 1990-91 and Victoria was facing a significant downturn and would be unlikely to “to stave off what is shaping as a big hit from the outbreak of Covid”, particularly due to its reliance on tourism.The ABS data also shows dramatic changes in the healthcare and social assistance sector workforce. About 63% of businesses made changes to the workforce because of Covid-19, including 44% which reported they had reduced work hours of staff, 42% which said they had changed the location of their staff, and 17% which had placed staff on unpaid leave.About 9% of healthcare or social assistance businesses said they had temporarily increased work hours."

KwaZulu-Natal is the worst-hit province of the country, and Eshowe is among the very worst-hit communities.But, even in Eshowe, there is a growing belief in a future without HIV. “I think one day there will be no more HIV here, there will be no more discrimination, and the people of Eshowe will be free, free, free,” said Sthandwa Buthelezi, a municipal worker who lost her parents, daughter and three sisters to HIV.Across South Africa, senior officials involved in the fight against HIV say they are more optimistic than ever before. “We are in a much, much better place … it is an effort that has involved many, many people,” said Yogen Pillay, South Africa’s deputy director general for health. “There is no magic bullet here … ultimately you need a strong health system and you have got to work with communities.”Buthelezi’s story is also that of her community, and in part that of South Africa, where the first HIV cases were reported in 1982, when she was nine.“Eshowe was very nice. Life was so good to me when I was little. I had my family, my sisters, my parents, my church,” she remembered.Within a decade, everything had changed. By the mid-90s, prejudice and a series of disastrous failures of political will and understanding had crippled South Africa’s response to the HIV epidemic, and the disease was spreading fast.First, Buthelezi’s oldest sister fell ill. Then her mother, her father and two other sisters. Desperately sick, destitute, the family faced appalling prejudice and ignorance.“People were afraid of anyone who was HIV positive. My sister was a Sunday school teacher, but they told her to stay away. The doctors and nurses didn’t like us. My sister was sick. I went to them begging and crying. They said: ‘We can’t help you,’ and told me to take her home and give her vegetable juice,” she remembered. “Even my father said it was witchcraft. That’s why the family was sick.”Life-saving antiretroviral (ARV) drugs that allow people with HIV to live a full and healthy life, reducing it to a manageable condition like diabetes or hypertension while also preventing onward transmission, were not available in Eshowe at the time.Thabo Mbeki, president from 1999 to 2008, questioned the link between HIV and suppressed immunity, suggesting that other factors could be responsible for the high mortality rate among those living with the virus. The high-level political resistance to the distribution of ARVs may have cost as many as 300,000 lives, some experts have estimated.The difference between Mbeki’s approach and the vigorous, sweeping and rapid response of South Africa’s current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and his energetic health minister, Zweli Mkhize, to coronavirus is striking.“The initial response is obviously in complete contrast with that to the HIV pandemic,” said Dr Richard Lessells, a specialist in infectious diseases based in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal’s largest city.Buthelezi’s mother died of tuberculosis, a common killer of those with HIV. Unfounded fears of possible infection made the family social outcasts. When Buthelezi’s oldest sister died, funeral workers and relatives refused to help with her corpse.“We were not even allowed to talk about HIV. They didn’t want to hear,” Buthelezi said. The failure to provide ARVs, which stop pregnant mothers transmitting the infection to their children, meant that her own daughter was born with HIV and died, in her mid-teens, in 2011.“She had started treatment, but too late,” Buthelezi, who tested positive for HIV in 2006, said.Yet there has been change. Almost 15 years ago, the South African government began backing the distribution of ARVs, helped by funding from the US under a scheme to fight HIV in Africa introduced by President George W Bush.The year Buthelezi’s daughter died, the international NGO Médicins Sans Frontières began a pilot project in Eshowe, which aimed to educate the community about HIV and mobilise local people to fight the disease themselves.Initiatives included a massive distribution of free condoms, promotion of adult male circumcision, a schools scheme, outreach to community leaders and traditional health practitioners, mobile testing vans and the deployment of huge numbers of community health workers.The experience of fighting the HIV pandemic is now informing the battle against Covid-19.One principal lesson from fighting HIV – and tuberculosis – is that if you don’t have the community with you, you won’t see the results you want.“They’ve been trying to do this with people, not just by telling them what to do … There’s been an excellent mass public information campaign. They really invested in communications,” said Lessells.Other resources for fighting infectious diseases in South Africa are now being repurposed to face a new enemy. It is hoped that almost 200 machines used to screen for tuberculosis can now be converted for use against Covid-19, for example, though the test kits and vital chemical agents may still be lacking.South Africa also has a well-developed network of community health workers, many of whom are now being redeployed to battle the new threat. Many of the initiatives piloted in Eshowe have been introduced elsewhere by national health authorities.But no one doubts the remaining challenges in the battle against HIV, or Covid-19. The project in Eshowe was very resource-intensive, and cannot be replicated everywhere. Though South Africa receives significant international aid and the country can also leverage the huge scale of its programme to bring down the huge cost of ARV treatment, the financial burden was huge, even before the vast expenditure caused by the coronavirus crisis. But that there has been huge progress is undeniable.“It has changed a lot,” said Buthelezi, whose 11-year-old son does not have HIV. “I am optimistic for my child. But there is still a lot to do.”"

She was diagnosed with myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow cancer, in 2016 and was due to have a transplant this month, but now fears it will be postponed as the country deals with the pandemic.Access for thousands of cancer patients in need of chemotherapy, scans, transplants and surgery has become difficult, if not impossible, in Italy’s Covid-19 emergency.Across the country, dozens of specialist cancer wards and hospitals have been transformed to treat coronavirus, while others have closed after medical staff and patients were infected. There are now fewer beds in intensive care units for cancer patients.“At the beginning of my diagnosis I underwent other treatments with success, but since my conditions worsened, transplant became my only option. So to be stuck in this situation make me living in a constant state of anxiety,” says Masi, who lives and works in Pontedera, in the province of Pisa. She is 46 and the mother of a 10-year-old boy. “I now run the risk of dying, which isn’t fair, because my doctors had finally located two foreign donors whose marrow was 100% compatible with mine.” International flight restrictions to halt the spread ofcoronavirus mean marrow from overseas donors risks not arriving in Italy.Research led by Codice Viola, a charity that supports pancreatic cancer patients, and seen exclusively by the Guardian, found that of 500 mostly breast or pancreatic patients appointments for chemotherapy or radiotherapy were postponed for 24% (11% with no arranged date), while 64% of surgical procedures were postponed indefinitely. More than half have had follow-up appointments rescheduled. Dozens of patients and doctors who spoke to the Guardian fear that the restrictive measures to contain the virus are limiting access to proper medical care for cancer patients, who also represent 17% of Italian coronavirus fatalities, according to a recent study.Francesca Pesce, 54, a professional translator and member of Codice Viola, has been living with metastatic pancreatic cancer for almost three years. This week she will leave Rome for a follow-up in Milan, one of the cities worst affected by the virus.“At least I have this option, which others don’t,” she said. “On the one hand, cancer patients are afraid of contracting the virus in hospitals, so they forgo their treatments; on the other, hospitals have been forced to cancel their appointments as many oncologists and anaesthetists have been moved to other wards to assist in the Covid-19 emergency.”Paolo Ascierto, an oncologist at Naples’ Pascale hospital now treating coronavirus patients, said converting cancer wards to Covid-19 units could be risky. “I understand the state of emergency, but we mustn’t forget that cancer patients require dedicated and specialised treatments. There are special conditions, like patients in follow-up, that can be managed safely using online consultations to monitor the patient’s progress.“But there are other conditions, such as metastatic patients, that must be prioritised, because a lack of constant attention can mean the difference between life and death.”In Ortona, Abruzzo, protests erupted following the announcement by local authorities that the only hospital in the region specialised in women’s cancer treatments was to be entirely converted to treat Covid-19 patients.Where cancer wards are functioning, certain diagnostic procedures, such as endescopies, may be limited, and a decrease in blood donations is limiting surgical options. “At the moment, only urgent surgical procedures are being performed,” says Pesce. “And even urgent procedures are now stymied, because of a shortage of blood due to the coronavirus emergency.”The closure of air routes to and from Italy has also made it virtually impossible for thousands of cancer patients to access treatment in other European hospitals.Alessandra Capone, 47, a dancer, feminist and human rights activist, has been living with breast cancer for 10 years. In 2015 it spread to her liver and lymph nodes and last year she began a series of treatments at University Hospital in Frankfurt with just 5% of her liver cancer-free. She is now facing enormous difficulties travelling to Germany.“I contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation but the line is always busy and I couldn’t speak to anybody. Then I contacted the Italian consulate in Frankfurt. They told me I need a number of certifications for travelling to another country, even for health reasons. Not to mention that in Germany very few hotels are accepting reservations, especially from Italians, during this emergency. It’s very stressful.”For the first time, however, the Italian government last week authorised an air force flight to Turkey to secure haemopoietic stem cells from a donor for a two-year-old boy whose condition had worsened.Travel is also limited within Italy, where patients from Sicily, Puglia and Calabria often undergo treatments and operations in richer Veneto and Lombardy, which are among the worst affected regions in the country for Covid-19.Grazia De Michele, 39, a blogger and researcher in the history of medicine, lives in Foggia, in Puglia, and has been living with breast cancer since 2010. A few months ago, her mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. “My mother was supposed to have a CT scan in March to see if the chemo she’s on is working, but the treatment was postponed,” she says. “I was supposed to undergo an oophorectomy, and my operation was postponed as well.”“You have to imagine what it’s like for cancer patients,” says Capone. “Many live in a constant state of anxiety, with the fear of dying. The situation caused by the coronavirus emergency has put them under enormous psychological and physical distress. You see, you can protect yourself from coronavirus by staying at home, but it’s not the same with cancer. Cancer doesn’t follow the diktat of quarantines or decrees. It keeps going, in war and in peace.”"

He wanted to help out even in a small way,” said a spokesperson.Varadkar, 41, worked as a junior doctor in Dublin and qualified as a GP in 2010 before quitting medicine to become a full-time politician, and later becoming premier.His return to medicine adds him to an eclectic group of public figures who have dusted off credentials to work as nurses and doctors in Europe’s battle against the pandemic.Coronavirus has made thousands of frontline health care workers ill and left many others unable to work because they need to stay at home to care for children or self-isolate because of potential infection. Health services across the continent have appealed to trainees, retirees and expatriates – anyone with useful skills – to help fill the gap.For Thomas Lilti, 43, a film director and showrunner, was filming the French medical TV drama Hippocrate in a hospital when the pandemic struck. He suspended filming and a few days later started working as a doctor – a profession he had quit in 2014 – in the same hospital.“I volunteered in casualty to try and help in a small way so the more competent doctors, those who really know what they are doing, can have a rest even if just for a few hours,” he told Le Journal du Dimanche.French sports figures have also reverted to former professions. Stéphanie dos Santos, 28, a basketballer, and Julien Mathieu, a ju-jitsu champion, are working as nurses. Thomas Carabas, 31, a rugby referee, has returned to work at Bayonne hospital.Politicians across Europe – and the political spectrum – have also responded.Katalin Cseh, 31, an MEP for Hungary’s opposition Momentum party, has returned from Brussels to Budapest and is to start her first shift as a volunteer medic on Tuesday.Cseh expressed concern about Hungary’s low level of testing and potential abuse of a new law against misinformation but volunteered “to show a good example”, she said. She will work part-time and unpaid while continuing to serve as an MEP.In France, Thomas Mesnier, 34, an MP for the governing La République en Marche, has returned to hospital work. Caroline Fiat, 43, an MP for La France Insoumise, has returned to work as a nurse. Bernard Jomier, 56, a Socialist party senator, and Véronique Guillotin, 57, a Radical Movement senator, have returned to the medical profession as doctors.In Northern Ireland, Kathryn Owen, 42, a Democratic Unionist party (DUP) councillor, is to resume working as a nurse this week at a hospital site that treats coronavirus patients. John Kyle, 68, a Progressive Unionist party (PUP) councillor, has come out of retirement as a GP despite being close to an at-risk age group.“Fear and powerlessness reinforce each other and I thought that taking action to join the army of healthcare workers combating the virus would help me handle those feelings,” Kyle said via email. “My medical instincts of wanting to help the ill and suffering were also reactivated and so volunteering seemed a natural response.”His family is supportive but worries given his age, he said. “I think it is the right thing to do … But fears can raise their ugly head in the middle of the night.”Varadkar rejoined Ireland’s medical register last month and has offered to help in areas within his competence, said a spokesperson for the taoiseach’s office.Brendan O’Shea, a doctor who trained Varadkar as a medical student, remembers him as competent and effective in his hospital jobs, training practices and GP co-operative work. “He got on very well with patients and colleagues, and was regarded as a good team player.”Varadkar, said O’Shea, once remarked that as a doctor people believed everything you said, but as a politician nobody believed a word."
"54","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/we-are-very-afraid-scramble-contain-coronavirus-mumbai-slum-dharavi","2020-04-07T00:00:15-0400","  'We are very afraid': scramble to contain coronavirus in Mumbai slum ","It was the news that many in India had feared. A 56-year-old man who lived in Dharavi, India’s largest slum, where almost 1 million people are densely packed together in a 2 sq km area in Mumbai, had tested positive for coronavirus. He died shortly after.It has prompted a scramble by local authorities to halt the virus before it takes hold in this overcrowded, unsanitary enclave, which was the inspiration for Danny Boyle’s film Slumdog Millionaire.But the prospect of attempting to contain transmission in a place where 10 people often live in a single room, more than 80 people share a public toilet and where many houses do not even have running water is already proving daunting to local officials. So far there are five known cases in Dharavi, while 25 people have been taken into special quarantine facilities and another 3,500 placed under home quarantine.“We are doing everything we can to make sure it does not explode and that there is no community spread, but it is a big challenge to contain this,” said Kiran Dighavkar, the assistant municipal commissioner for G-North ward of Mumbai.It appears that the 56-year-old garment worker who was the slum’s first victim had made two trips to the local Lokmanya Tilak municipal general hospital over the course of a week, presenting first with a fever and then severe respiratory problems, before he was tested by doctors. With no foreign travel history, he had not been considered high risk. But on 29 March, he tested positive for the virus and died four days later.There was initial confusion over how this man, who had never been abroad and lived with seven family members in a small flat adjacent to Dharavi, could possibly have contracted the virus. Yet while his family were initially uncooperative, it later emerged he had hosted several men who had attended a religious gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat sect of Islam in Delhi several weeks ago, which has since been linked to hundreds of coronavirus cases across India.The response by the authorities was swift. The area where the victim had lived was sealed off and remains so, and his family was taken into quarantine and all those in the building, or who were considered high risk, have been tested. A new 51-bed hospital in the Dharavi area, specifically to treat coronavirus patients, has also been acquired, with eight intensive care beds, though it is feared if the virus takes hold this will not be nearly enough.Other cases in the slum include a 30-year-old woman with no foreign travel history, and authorities are searching for the dozens who attended her birthday party a week ago.“There are already many health issues in Dharavi,” said Dighavkar, who added that one of the main obstacles in tackling the spread of coronavirus was a social stigma that prevented people from coming forward with symptoms.“But we are hopeful that they have good immunity because they have been exposed to many viruses, especially through using the community toilet, so we are hoping that if we find the high-risk contacts and put them in quarantine, we will be able to control it.”Babbu Khan, a municipal councillor in Dharavi, said he feared many more people were already infected and warned that undetected cases could “wreak havoc” in the slum, where the disease was likely to “spread like wildfire”.“For the slum-dwellers it is very difficult to stay safe from a coronavirus-infected neighbour in this incredibly congested slum of Dharavi,” said Khan. “When five people have already tested positive for the virus, there must be many more people around who are already infected. We know that many people carrying the virus remain asymptomatic, but still continue to spread the infection.”He added: “In Dharavi, 99% of the residents do not have their private toilets and they use public toilets. One seat of a public toilet is used by 50 or 60 slum-dwellers daily. There is a very high possibility that the infection of coronavirus is spreading or has already spread through these public toilets.”Overall Mumbai has one of the highest concentrations of coronavirus cases in the country and on Monday, three doctors and 26 nurses of Wockhardt hospital in Mumbai tested positive, bringing the total number of cases in the state of Maharashtra to 809.Within Dharavi, fear has already begun to take hold. Mohammad Shafi Alam Shaikh, 53, who trades in school bags and lives in the MP Nagar area of Dharavi along with his wife and four children, said many people were very scared about the “new disease”.“Many of my neighbours are very nervous and staying indoors,” he said. “They are coming out of their homes only to use public toilets. All of them say that it is very difficult to escape the infection in such congested slums. They all are afraid of being infected.”Many mosques in the slum are using their public announcement system to spread awareness about Covid-19. But Shaikh said most of the advised measures for hand-washing and social distancing were an impossibility for the people of Dharavi.“Many people do not have food at home and so in search of provisions and food handouts, people are being forced to stay outside their homes for a long time. At places like ration shops and free food delivery points people are still gathering in big numbers,” said Shaikh. “So we are very afraid of a fast spread of the virus.”"

This article will be updated as new laws are implemented or repealed.Queensland has announced a state of emergency, and along with enforcing the two-person limit, residents are now only allowed to leave their home for one of eight essential reasons. These are:Obtaining food or other essential goods or servicesObtaining medical treatment or other healthcare servicesEngaging in physical exercise, either alone or in the company of no more than one other person; or in the company of a family group who ordinarily live in the same householdPerforming work on behalf of an employer that is engaged in essential business, activity or undertaking, and the work to be performed is of a nature that cannot reasonably be performed from the person’s principal place of residenceVisiting a terminally ill relative or to attend a funeralProviding assistance, care or support to an immediate member of the person’s familyAttending any court of Australia or to comply with or give effect to orders of the courtAttending a childcare facility, school, university or other educational institution, to the extent care or instruction cannot reasonably be obtained in the person’s principal place of residenceLearning to drive, with one licensed family member or guardianA full list can be found here.Queensland now restricts gatherings of more than two people. This applies in public areas but exempts members of the same household.This means if someone leaves their house for an essential reason, such as exercise, they can be joined by only one other person or the members of their household.In early April, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said that inside a person’s home they were allowed to have all the members of the household and two guests.Palaszczuk said this amendment is intended to help families who may not all live in the same home to stay connected. She also clarified that those who live alone are allowed to have one or two social guests.Queensland police officers will be able to issue on-the-spot fines of $1,334.50 for individuals and $6,672.50 for corporations, who breach these laws. The maximum penalties available through the courts will be 10 times those amounts.From 3 April, Queensland borders will be closed to everyone except residents and essential workers, including freight carriers and emergency workers. This includes erecting barriers in the Gold Coast suburb of Coolangatta, which straddles both Queensland and NSW.There are some exemptions for those who regularly cross the Queensland-NSW border for work.As of 12am Tuesday, NSW residents now legally have to stay in their homes unless they have a “reasonable excuse” for leaving.“Reasonable excuses” are broadly categorised as:Obtaining food or other goods and servicesTravelling for the purposes of work or education if the person cannot do it at homeExerciseMedical or caring reasonsThe full list of reasonable excuses can be found here.The state’s police commissioner, Michael Fuller, said that visiting romantic partners would be considered to fall under “care” as it supports mental health.Movement is also allowed for the purpose of moving into a new home or inspecting a potential new home, providing care or assistance to a vulnerable person or in an emergency, and undertaking legal obligations, accessing government services, or donating blood. Exemptions also exist for priests or members of religious orders, and where someone is escaping potential injury, illness or harm.People who are learning to drive can continue to learn to drive and get their hours logged.Children who live across two households can continue to switch between houses.NSW has also adopted the two-person gathering limit.Fuller indicated that police would be on the streets to enforce these new rules.The new laws were published late on Monday night. They allow for fines of up to $11,000 or six months’ imprisonment for those who leave the home without a reasonable excuse, plus an additional $5,500 fine each day the offence continues. Fines for businesses are higher still.It appears it will be left to police officers’ discretion who will receive a fine.Victoria has adopted a similar system.Residents can only leave the house for one of five essential reasons. These are:Shopping for food or other essential goods and servicesWork and educationCare and compassionate reasonsExerciseOther extenuating circumstancesA full breakdown of these reasons can be found here.The two-person gathering rules also apply inside and outside the home. This rule exempts people who live in the same household, whether this be a family unit or roommates.Victoria’s chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton, tweeted on Wednesday that exemptions would be made for visiting romantic partners.Police officers are responsible for deciding who will receive penalties. They may ask individuals to prove why they are out of the home or prove a group are members of the same household, but deputy commissioner Shane Patton said officers would use “common sense” and were experienced in knowing who was being truthful.Victorians cannot visit family members who do not live with them, but may drop off food and supplies for care and compassionate reasons.Children who may need to move between the houses of their parents or carers are also allowed to travel, and court-ordered visitation rights for parents can also be upheld.Penalties include on-the-spot fines of up to $1,652 for individuals and $9,913 for businesses. Larger fines and even the possibility of criminal charges are also available.The premier, Daniel Andrews, said this new wave of restrictions was part of the state’s “stage three” shutdown.A teenager was fined for getting lessons on how to drive, but on Monday night the Victoria Police said the commissioner would review the fine.Tasmania has implemented a similar system, with individuals only allowed to leave their homes for essential reasons and gatherings limited to two people. However there is more scope for exemptions from these rules than in other states.Reason for Tasmanians to go out in public include:Shopping for suppliesUndertaking personal exerciseAttending medical or healthcare appointments or for medical treatment.Seeking veterinary servicesProviding social support or care to another personAttending school or study, if unable to be done at homeAttending work, or volunteering, if unable to be done at homePerforming essential maintenance, or security inspections, of other premises owned or occupied, by the personAttending another location if the person has a reasonable excuse, in the opinion of the director of public healthAn example of a “reasonable excuse” given by the premier’s office was clearing out a recently deceased relative’s house.Tasmania also restricts gatherings of more than two people inside and outside the home, however they have a broad definition of exempted “social support”. This allows families to visit one another’s homes, couples who live apart to stay at each other’s residences, and those who live alone to have visitors.However, in public, the two-person gathering limit is strictly applied.Australian defence force members, the Tasmanian State Emergency Service, and fire service volunteers have been enlisted to help carry out spot checks.Fines could be as much as $16,800 or six months in jail.Tasmania also requires that all non-essential traveller entering the state quarantine for a period of 14 days.Western Australian has now adopted strict border restrictions, dividing the state into nine regions that residents can not move between without good reason.Reasons for crossing include:Travelling to workAttending medical appointmentsTransporting freightAccessing groceries or supplies if these are not available in the current regionReturning homeAttending school or other educational institutionsSupporting family members where necessaryCompassionate groundsWA will not be fining residents for leaving their homes for non-essential reasons, however, the premier still urged residents to stay home wherever possible and take a “common sense” approach.The state has followed federal recommendations of limiting gatherings to no more than two people, both inside and outside the home. This exempts those living in the same house, as well as weddings and funerals.In WA, you are allowed to be joined by all those in your household and one guest, and there are some further exemptions for family.Legislation will enter parliament this week to allow police officers to issue on-the-spot fines for those who do not comply. However, fines of up to $50,000 are currently available through the courts.The premier said drones would also be used to break up gatherings, flying over beaches, parks and other likely social hotspots and broadcasting messages about social distancing rules through speakers.The premier is also seeking to pass laws that will allow police to compel someone who fails to comply with a self-isolation order to wear an electronic device and make it a criminal offence to purposefully cough or sneeze on a healthcare worker or emergency service worker if you have Covid-19.WA has opted to tighten restrictions at borders rather than inside the state.The state has now instituted a hard border closure. As of midnight on 6 April only “exempt travellers” will be allowed in. This includes WA residents.A list of “exempt travellers” can be found here, and includes senior government officials, military personal and a range of essential workers.In a statement, the Australian Capital Territory chief minister, Andrew Barr, said the ACT would also enforce the two-person limit.In homes however, households are allowed up to two additional guests, as long as there is still at least four square metres per person indoors. Barr has urged residents not to leave their home, except for certain essential reasons.These are:Shopping for what you need – food and necessary suppliesMedical or healthcare needs, including compassionate requirementsExercise in compliance with the public gathering requirementsWork and study if you can’t work or learn remotelyACT police officers would be issuing a warning in the first instance.Guardian Australia understands that police would focus on enforcing the two-person gathering limits, not why people have left their homes.The Northern Territory announced it would not be enforcing the two-person gathering rules.The chief minister, Michael Gunner, said it would stick to the 10-person limit for now but would bring in stricter laws if people did not follow social distancing rules.“If the police need to go around enforcing a lower limit, they will, but we expect Territorians will do the right thing and save our police the time and hassle,” he said.The Northern Territory now requires any non-essential travellers to self-quarantine for a period of 14 days. Remote communities also have protection in place to stop non-essential visitors from entering.So far South Australia has opted not to enforce new two-person-gathering laws.Premier Steven Marshall has urged people to follow these rules, however on-the-spot fines of $1,000 will still only be applied to those who are gathering in groups larger than 10.Social distancing rules must still be followed, and gatherings with less than 10 people indoors must abide by the one person per four square meters rules.All people entering South Australia are required to undertake a 14-day quarantine."

 How the right is responding to the coronavirus: denial, realism or dangerous contrarianism ","Crises have a habit of accelerating changes that were already in train.Some of the trends being pushed along by the pandemic are benign, or neutral, like the evolution of better protocols around remote work and telecommuting.Others are more sinister, like the fast-track evolution of factions in the political right whose message may be seductive to unwary or embittered progressives.Coronavirus has very quickly expanded existing fissures on the right. We can see influential actors lighting out on three main paths.The first path is denying, minimising or deliberately courting the public health danger.Some from particularly conspiratorial or religious segments of the right have claimed outright that the emergency is a “psyop” intended to institute tyranny.Maga loyalists like the ineffable Bill Mitchell have been playing it down, seeing a threat to President Donald Trump’s political interests.And locally, Andrew Bolt has plumbed new depths in his campaign to end the various levels of social isolation now in place and get everyone back to work. It’s not clear whether he derives this opinion from simple contrarianism or from his discussions with big business figures whose fortunes, and prospects, are ebbing by the day.In the US, the denialists and minimisers — including the president — are about to be confronted with the grim reality of the coronavirus death toll. Even then some will find ways to keep lying to themselves and their audiences. The rightwing e-celeb Candace Owens, for example, is forestalling her own reckoning by putting about the idea that the deaths themselves are hoaxes.The second main line of the right’s response is a kind of reluctant realism. This (with some prominent exceptions) has been the path taken by many governing conservatives in liberal democracies.Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson botched their initial responses, with Morrison in particular giving stunningly bad public health advice as the pandemic gathered steam overseas.But it gradually dawned on these leaders that they urgently needed to abandon habits of thought developed over a lifetime in order to save their societies’ furniture.Both have been shoveling out money out to individuals, businesses, daycare centers, and health systems. As much as the individual welfare of their citizens, these men were looking to save their economies.But partial, poorly implemented and uneven their measures were, they constituted a practical admission that late capitalist systems are simply not resilient enough to withstand a crisis of these dimensions.The inevitability of further disasters and public health crises as our climate crisis unfolds will everywhere force the admission that the neoliberal, managerial state simply doesn’t cut the mustard.The question is: what will take its place?In answering we should note that as usual in Australian politics, governments confronted with a political problem reached for authoritarianism.Police were issuing fines, and the army was in parks and streets before people were given a decent chance to cooperatively adhere to a shifting and confusing set of rules.Ships were denied access to ports of entry. Returning travelers were subject to mandatory confinement. The Pacific solution had come home.This authoritarian instinct has been even more pronounced in rightwing leaders elsewhere.In Hungary Viktor Orbán has swept away the vestiges of liberal democracy in the country. He has used this crisis to lock the population down, control information and scapegoat his enemies.These responses define the disease as a national emergency rather than a global humanitarian crisis. They are answered, to some extent, by popular authoritarianism – in Facebook groups and comment threads you’ll find people baying for mass arrests of social-distancing violators and cheering for sealed borders.Not everyone has reacted this way – this is also a golden age of community-level mutual aid and cross-border empathy.But there is enough nasty sentiment around to create an opportunity for a third kind of rightwing response to coronavirus.This response seeks to retool conservatism, reverse liberal internationalism and globalization and use the pandemic as a springboard for global conflict.Its avatar is Steve Bannon, whose pandemic-focused podcast has been a rightwing standout in a sea of corona content.Bannon took the outbreak seriously, and he did so early. He was devoting special episodes of his War Room podcast to the pandemic from late January. He perceived it as a looming disaster, even as most other news outlets were entirely focused on impeachment and the Democratic primaries.And he immediately sought to blame the entire outbreak on the Chinese Communist party. A 27 January episode called it “China’s Chernobyl” in its title. He regularly describes the party as demonic or satanic.He has, in the face of small government orthodoxy, urged sweeping welfare payments and an all-out effort to smother the virus.He has rhetorically adopted a certain bipartisanism, praising New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, and other Democrats, while also avoiding any discussion of Trump’s murderous incompetence. But all of this is framed by an unyielding nationalism focused on the evil of the CCP.His apparent prescience on the story, and his enduring populist opposition to neoliberal orthodoxies in rightwing politics, appear to have some attraction for leftists at a time when leftwing populism appears stalled, at least in electoral politics.Bannon was a guest on a prominent leftwing podcast last week (that show shall remain nameless – it’s had more than enough attention as a result of this).It’s not an important development in itself but it signals a danger.Bannon’s nationalism, anti-Chinese aggression, and his western chauvinism should deter anyone who claims to be on the left. But in a moment of frustration, his populism, relaxed attitude to government spending, and his robust approach to the pandemic may be a lure for the politically unsophisticated.Indeed, this is his political project.This goes double for the right. In Australia, too, prominent voices are making it their business to ensure that this pandemic is blamed entirely on the PRC, and that this leads to a posture of conflict with that country. This will inevitably worsen the scapegoating of Asian immigrants which is being reported in majority-white countries.Progressives need to start forcefully making their own arguments about the meaning of the crisis. They need to offer a response that emphasises social solidarity, equity, justice and peace.Otherwise we may exchange neoliberalism for something even worse.Jason Wilson is a columnist for Guardian Australia"

Just 73% of men increased hygiene measures compared with 83% of women. Some 75% of men stopped hugging and handshaking, compared with 82% of women.The proportion of voters who trust the government is giving honest and objective advice rose from 56% on 22 March to 63% last Monday.Trust in the media to provide honest and objective information about Covid-19 jumped from 35% to 51% over the same two-week period.Younger voters aged 18-34 – the least vulnerable to the coronavirus – are more likely than others to be critical of the response to it. Essential Research found 28% believed the response has been an overreaction.Just 11% of the voters most at risk from the infection, those aged 55+, think there has been an overreaction; 47% in this cohort consider the response has been about right, and 42% think the threat is being underestimated.The menace of the virus remains strong with 41% of all voters fearing they are very likely or somewhat likely to become a victim.Strikingly, the most fatalistic age group is 18-34, of whom 49% say they are very or somewhat likely to catch Covid-19. That compares with those aged 55+, medically the most likely to be struck down, of whom 34% say they are likely to be victims.Some 70% of voters believe they have been kept informed on the situation and the impact on families, according to the Essential Research. This compared with 63% just a week earlier.And in a sign of confidence, some 52% of voters believe their finances will not be affected by the impact of the coronavirus, or that their savings will see them through.But the dominant view, from 51%, was that the economy will be in trouble for six to 12 months, and grow slowly after that.Households with dependent children are more worried about their financial futures, with 36% fearing they will struggle with a short-term loss of income, and a further 19% expecting to suffer serious financial stress."

I also want to apologize directly to Captain Crozier, his family, and the entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt for any pain my remarks may have caused.”Modly sparked a leadership crisis at the Pentagon when an audio recording surfaced of a speech he gave to the crew of the aircraft carrier, in which he denigrated the commander he had fired for having circulated a memo calling for more help for his crew, who had been stricken by a coronavirus outbreak onboard. The acting navy secretary’s apology came soon after Donald Trump said on Monday evening he would intervene in the situation, and hinted he might reinstate the former Roosevelt commander Captain Brett Crozier.“His career prior to that was very good. So I’m going to get involved and see exactly what’s going on there because I don’t want to destroy somebody for having a bad day,” Trump said, while stressing that Crozier should not have circulated the memo.Referring to Modly and Crozier, the president added: “Two good people ... they were arguing. And I’m good, believe it or not, at settling arguments … So I may look into it in great detail. And I’ll be able to figure it out very fast.”In the recording of Modly’s speech on board the Roosevelt, published by the Task & Purpose military news website, heckling can be heard from the crew during the speech, which was otherwise greeted with silence.Modly justified his decision to relieve Capt Crozier of command last week, on the grounds that his four-page memo requesting more help for his crew, and asking for them to be moved on shore at Guam, had been circulated to more than 40 people. It was leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle, but Modly did not accuse Crozier of the leak.“If he didn’t think that information was going to get out into the public in this information age that we live in, then he was a too naive or too stupid to be the commanding officer of a ship like this,” Modly said.In his apology on Monday night, Modly said: “I believe, precisely because he is not naive or stupid, that he sent his alarming email with the intention of getting it into the public domain in an effort to draw public attention to the situation on his ship.”During Mody’s speech on Sunday, someone (presumably a crew member) can be heard yelling “What the fuck?” Crozier was a popular captain and video circulated on Friday of the crew massing on the deck of the Roosevelt to cheer and chant the captain’s name as he left the ship, walking down the gangplank to a waiting car.Modly criticised the crew for cheering, saying that they should think of the people of Guam, who were concerned about being infected by sick sailors brought ashore. He attacked the media, which he said were seeking to embarrass the navy, and accused Crozier of betrayal.“It was a betrayal of trust with [sic] me, with his chain of command, with you, with the 800 to 1,000 people who are your shipmates on shore right now busting their asses every day to do what they need to do to ... to get you guys off here, get you safe, get you healthy, get you clean,” he said.“Everyone’s scared about this thing. But I tell you something – if this ship was in combat and there were hypersonic missiles coming at it, you’d be pretty fucking scared too,” he said, to a shout of “Whoa!” from the crew. “But you do your jobs.”So far, according to the Pentagon, 61% of the Roosevelt crew has been tested for Covid-19, and 173 members have tested positive. Two thousand sailors, just under half the crew, have been moved ashore on Guam, though none have been hospitalised as yet.At least four Democratic members of Congress and an independent, Justin Lamash, called for Modly’s immediate resignation.“Modly should be removed unceremoniously for these shocking remarks – especially after failing to protect sailors’ safety & health. He has betrayed their trust,” Senator Richard Blumenthal said on Twitter, calling for a Pentagon investigation.David Lapan, a former Pentagon spokesman and ex-marine, tweeted: “These remarks to sailors are unbefitting a senior leader and will only increase divisiveness in the ranks. He has failed as a leader & should resign.”After the recording of his speech was published, Modly issued a statement saying he had not listened to the recording but that “the spoken words were from the heart”.“I stand by every word I said, even, regrettably any profanity that may have been used for emphasis,” he said.Modly became acting secretary in November after the former navy secretary Richard Spencer was fired for dissenting from Trump’s attempt to exonerate a navy seal, Eddie Gallagher, who had been accused of war crimes and was demoted after being found guilty of posing with the corpse of an Islamic State fighter."

The prime minister, Scott Morrison, was announcing a further tightening of restrictions, including the “very difficult” decision to limit attendance at funerals to 10 people.Bert turned to family members caring for him and said without fuss: “Oh well, that’s you seven [children] and three more.”Early the next morning, Bert, 82, died in his recliner chair. For the Cattermole family, like others throughout the country and the world, Covid-19 has brought a further layer of grief to losing a close family member. It’s the “no touching” that seems cruel. No embraces, no arm around a shoulder, no comfort for the weeping.Jane Cattermole, 58, the fourth of Bert’s eight children (one sibling is not in contact with the family), helped look after her father at her sister Ann’s house in the final days.For such a large family – Bert had 24 grandchildren and 34 great-grandchildren – it was especially difficult. Visits were limited to the adult children.“Some of the grandkids did visit but mainly we were strict about that,” says Jane. “We FaceTimed so the grandkids could have a chat with him when he perked up a little bit. Most of them rang up and said goodbye to him over video.”The limit of 10 at a funeral is extraordinary but Australia has so far imposed less severe restrictions than some countries. In Italy and New Zealand funerals are banned.Bert had no religious convictions, but for those who do, the rituals around burial are ancient. Muslims, for instance, wash the body, wrap it in a shroud, and hold communal prayer.Under Covid-19 health department guidelines, close handling of the body is not recommended but it can be done under strict conditions. They advise that families should not kiss the deceased.The days after someone dies are always strange. Apart from the emotion and exhaustion of it, there’s so much to be done. The siblings comforted each other from afar, and the meeting with the celebrant was on FaceTime.The funeral was held in Baldivis, a suburb of Perth, at 10am last Friday. Ten cream chairs were set up in the chapel, all spaced apart. Jane was the first in, followed at a distance by nine others (the Western Australian government allowed 10 family members, plus two officials). There were seven of Bert’s children – Margaret, Paul, Ann, Jane, Andrew, Angela and James – and three of their partners.The celebrant, Kevin Clune, told the tiny gathering that “without the needs of our current stage of containing Covid-19, this chapel would be overflowing”. During this crisis, modern technology is helping maintain connection, even at funerals. It was livestreamed so family and friends could watch.Every life is unique, every family complicated. Jane’s eulogy outlined her father’s life, from his days as a Yorkshire coalminer, marrying Mary at a young age, and bringing their rowdy mob of kids to Australia in 1975 as “10-pound poms”. Mary died a few years ago and Bert nursed her to the end.A kidney donation from a 13-year-old boy saved Bert’s life and he savoured the two decades it gave him. He was a “good, decent, fair and generous man”, Jane says. When he was encouraged to go off all drugs towards the end, to surrender to death, he refused to stop taking the anti-rejection medication that protected his kidney. “He wanted to honour that little boy and his family to the end.”Her father had at first struggled to accept Jane’s and another sister’s sexuality, treating their same-sex partners with coldness. That changed, and in his final days of life he apologised for his early intolerance. “He wanted us to know that he loved us and always had.”The rituals of a funeral were all there. Bert’s closest friends, Olive and Noel Grafton, could not attend owing to the restrictions, but Angela read out a letter from them to honour more than 40 years of friendship. A poem was read on behalf of the grandchildren. Bert’s favourite song, Tom T Hall’s Old Dogs, Children and Watermelon Wine, filled the chapel.Towards the end of the service, Jane reached over and threw her arms around Ann. It was against the rules but Jane does not regret it. “Ann just cried the whole way through,” she says. “She was the one whose house he was in. It was so sad, and she just lost it a little bit.”One day, when all this is over, the Cattermole family plans a big celebration of Bert’s life; when all the family and friends can be there, and everyone can tell stories and hug each other. They understand that it has to wait.“We never would have expected his last days and funeral would occur this way,” Jane says. “Other generations have had to deal with different hardships and we’ve just got to deal with this.”The family’s biggest fear was that the funeral would somehow seem makeshift, not a “proper” funeral. But it felt real.“I actually thought it was quite beautiful. It was quite intimate ... It was kind of strangely perfect to me. It was just us and it was just fine.”We’d like to hear your story about how you are managing during this crisis. Email: postcards@theguardian.com"

But almost a fortnight into restrictive nationwide lockdown measures intended to halt the spread of Covid-19, a bored and anxious public has developed an obsession with the single grey area in the shutdown rules: going outside to exercise.Prime minister Jacinda Ardern activated a four-week lockdown on 25 March that requires New Zealanders to stay in their homes unless they are accessing essential services – such as groceries or medical help – or heading outside for fresh air.But unlike some European nations, which have set restrictions for how far one can venture out while walking, new guidelines issued to New Zealanders last week suggested outdoor activity was permissible in locations “readily accessed” from someone’s home, providing it was not likely to put them in danger or at risk of requiring rescue.It didn’t suggest an exact distance for what constituted “readily accessible”, to the chagrin of some New Zealanders.“It’s partly heightened anxiety that causes us to become really rule-bound because we see those rules as things that could protect us,” says Dougal Sutherland, the clinical practice manager at Victoria University’s school of psychology. “If you think about fight-or-flight mechanisms being highly activated, anybody who could be seen to be breaching those could be putting us at risk.”Those breaking the rules by partaking in barred activities have included a surfer pictured flipping the bird at an Auckland beach on Sunday, and people jumping off a Queenstown bridge into the river below, who were shamed in a Facebook post by the local council.But some people out walking or cycling while apparently abiding by the guidelines have also incurred the public’s wrath: one woman said she and her family were abused while walking along an Auckland beach by a man who did not believe they all lived in the same house (they do), and photos of others out on the street have been posted on social media.One Twitter user said they had placed a sign by the reserve at the end of their street, telling those who had driven there to exercise to turn back because they were not welcome. Cycling and running groups on social media have devoted countless words to debating how many kilometres constituted a reasonable distance from home, while others have posted on Facebook branding those leaving home for recreation, even for walks, as “selfish” and “dumb”.“Just because you can doesn’t mean you should,” said one commenter in a popular New Zealand Facebook group. Walks should be taken “within your block. Not a leisurely walk through the park or gardens,” said another.Others pointed to comments at officials’ daily press briefings in which Ardern and others had extolled the benefits of getting a little fresh air.The requirement to “stay local” didn’t mean “wandering off for five or six miles”, said Mike Bush, the police commissioner, in a news conference last week. But he didn’t add what a reasonable distance was. Despite near-daily questions from reporters positing different – often very specific – scenarios in which someone might take to the outdoors, Ardern and other officials have declined to provide exact numbers for how far someone should travel by foot or bicycle from their homes to exercise.But many on social media claim to have heard distance-specific rules; after a satirical April Fool’s Day post on the website Kiwiblog claimed that a 500-metre distance from home would be enforced by the police, the claim was spread by some as fact.Sutherland says people can become “really rigid in their interpretations of rules”, when anxious, clinging to mentions of numbers or specific boundaries as providing “a sense of safety”.“We tend to look for information that will fit with our view of the current situation,” he said, adding that there was also “a jealousy thing … ‘If I’m not doing it, why should they be allowed to?’”One cycling advocate said those on bicycles – an activity that is still permitted – had come in for particular abuse.“I’ve heard numerous reports of more people and vehicles speeding and hooning and doing what we call a punishment pass, speeding too close to you while you’re cycling,” said Patrick Morgan from the Cycling Action Network. “It’s intended to punish a person for riding a bike. It’s dangerous and scary and it’s illegal.”An Auckland-based member of the network, Paul Baron, wrote on Facebook that he had “copped abuse” three times in the course of a week about the fact that he was cycling, including while out with his children. And the health minister, David Clark, came in for criticism too when his car was spotted parked at a mountain bike trail close to his home, although he did not appear to have broken any rules. He was later stripped of his associate finance minister portfolio and demoted in cabinet rankings after it emerged he also drove his family 20km to the beach during the lockdown.Some fitness buffs have eschewed the outdoors entirely by emulating the man in France who ran a marathon on his balcony last month. More than 300 New Zealanders signed up to run a marathon around their homes at the weekend, posting updates, photos and videos from the hundreds of laps they took of their gardens.Sutherland says that as time goes on, and public-spiritedness starts to flag, it would be more difficult for officials to ensure New Zealanders follow the lockdown rules. But for now, some people have more time on their hands than usual, and combined with endless access to social media and a heightened sense of vigilance, it could prove a potent mix.“It’s a bit like your retired neighbour and the curtains keep twitching every time someone walks past,” he says. “We’re all sort of standing at the curtains.”"

They’ve come with the solutions and just have done incredible jobs – and I’ve asked him to contact London immediately,” Trump said. “They’ve really advanced therapeutics … and they have arrived in London already. The London office has whatever they need. We’ll see if we can be of help. We’ve contacted all of Boris’s doctors, and we’ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go.”“They’ve had meetings with the doctors, and we’ll see whether or not they want to go that route,” Trump added. “But when you’re in intensive care it’s a big deal. So they’re there and they’re ready.”Trump heaped praise on Johnson, who he has consistently seen as one of his closest allies.“We’re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery,” the president said. “He’s been a really good friend. He’s been really something very special: strong, resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up.”Asked by the Guardian whether the prime minister’s initially relaxed approach to the pandemic may have been a mistake, Trump – who took a similar approach in the early weeks – replied cautiously.“Boris was looking at it differently. He was looking at it earlier. He was looking at it like: ride it out. There were many people thinking about riding it out. Meaning, whatever it is, it is. But then you see what starts to happen, then the numbers become monumental, and they decided not to do that.”Describing Monday’s call with the four pharmaceutical company heads, the White House spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said: “We are working hard to tear down barriers, cut red tape, & encourage cooperation across private industries and government.”"

A spokeswoman said the move was a precaution in case the prime minister needs ventilation.Johnson was admitted to hospital on Sunday, with officials saying the symptoms of coronavirus from which he has been suffering were persisting.According to Johns Hopkins University, 1,337,749 people around the world are known to have been infected, while at least 73,917 have died. The scale of the outbreak is likely to be greater as some countries are suspected of underreporting their figures. The researchers say 275,883 people have recovered.Dominic Raab will deputise for Johnson while the latter is in hospital. In a televised interview, the foreign secretary said the UK government’s coronavirus fight would continue and ministers would focus on implementing the prime minister’s plan.The French president Emmanuel Macron said he hoped the UK prime minister made a speedy recovery, while the US president Donald Trump said he was praying for Johnson. Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau and the Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar were among those to send their best wishes.Prominent figures from across the UK’s political landscape offered their support to Johnson as his condition deteriorated.The death toll in French hospitals increased by 10% in a day to a cumulative total of 6,494, the country’s health minister Olivier Véran said. He added that, including partial data about the number of people who have died in nursing homes, the total death toll from the disease rose to 8,911 from 8,078 on Sunday, also a rise of 10%.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said 8,910 people had died as a result of the pandemic and the country had 330,891 reported cases.The country will reopen daycare centres and schools for children in first to fifth grade starting 15 April, if the numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths remain stable, its prime minister said.Other restrictions will remain in place until at least 10 May and the ban on big gatherings will stay until August.The country had recorded the fewest deaths in any day for two weeks but Monday’s figures showed the numbers accelerating again, with a further 636 new deaths; 111 more than the number registered on Sunday. That brought the toll in Italy to 16,523.The number of current new infections increased by 1,941 – a rise of 2% since Sunday and the lowest day-to-day rise registered since 30 March.The latest figures released by health authorities in Greece offered a glimmer of hope. The prominent infectious diseases expert, Sotirios Tsiodras, said data suggested the country was “flattening the curve”."

I’m really proud of our members.”The first lecture being broadcast at 11am on Tuesday is by the art historian Jacqueline Cockburn and was recorded in her home by her son. She had been due to lecture on Picasso at the society’s now-cancelled annual general meeting and suggested Las Meninas, which hangs in the Prado in Madrid, as a shorter alternative for the new project.Subsequent lectures will include talks by Antiques Roadshow regulars Mark Hill and Marc Allum, the UK’s leading Aboriginal art expert Rebecca Hossack, and the art critic Sarah Dunant. Tate curator and JMW Turner expert Nicola Moorby will talk about the new £20 note, which features the artist.The Arts Society consists of 380 individual membership groups, which organise regular lectures and educational trips to museums and galleries throughout the year.Schweizer said the new digital platform, titled The Arts Society Connected, aims to help people stay “educated, entertained and informed” over the next three months.It will be free to members or indeed anyone who fancies watching and taking part in community forums before and after the events.As well as fortnightly lectures there will be monthly film screenings, beginning with one titled Easter in Art. There will also be a package of social media training for people who feel they need it.The initiative is one of many being launched by museums, galleries, charities and individual artists to help get people through the lockdown.“We believe the arts have the power to bring people together, and we will not let this virus stop communities from enjoying the arts with each other,” said Schweizer.“We are working with our thousands of volunteers to develop new skills and initiatives, building resilience and a future in which many of our members will embrace digital as a valuable addition to their cultural experience.”"

Now, however, the economic emergency will not be resolved until the health emergency is effectively addressed: the health emergency will not end simply by conquering the disease in one country alone, but by ensuring recovery from Covid-19 in all countries.”The letter was signed by, among others, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and John Major, the former president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon, financier George Soros and the nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz.The letter said that in addition to the $8bn of emergency health spending, developing countries would need $150bn to fight the twin medical and economic challenges.Both the IMF and the World Bank have been urging creditor countries to defer interest payments on bilateral poor-country debt this year, saving them $14bn, but the group of 165 leaders said the international community should go further and agree a more generous package, worth $44bn to Africa alone.The IMF and the World Bank will hold spring meetings by teleconference, with finance ministers discussing plans to beef up the financial resources of the two Washington-based organisations.The letter to the G20 said the IMF needed an additional $500-600bn in the form of special drawing rights: a form of international currency that can be used to increase the reserves of member states. Extra funds would also be needed to help the World Bank meet demands for help.Citing research by Imperial College London, the letter said 1.2 million Covid-19 deaths were possible in Africa and Asia’s poorest countries.It said even the best funded health systems were struggling to cope with the pandemic. “Yet, if we do nothing as the disease spreads in poorer African, Asian and Latin American cities and in fragile communities which have little testing equipment, ventilators and medical supplies; and where social distancing and even washing hands are difficult to achieve, Covid-19 will persist there and re-emerge to hit the rest of the world with further rounds that will prolong the crisis.”It added: “Much has been done by national governments to counter the downward slide of their economies. But a global economic problem requires a global economic response.”"
"72","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients","2020-04-06T19:00:09-0400","  Doctors lacking PPE 'bullied' into treating Covid-19 patients ","Doctors in Britain are being “bullied and shamed” into treating patients with Covid-19 despite not having the masks, gowns and eyewear they need to protect themselves from the virus, frontline medics have said.Others are being told to hold their breath to avoid getting infected because of persistent shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) .The findings raise questions about how far a huge effort by NHS bosses, ministers and the military has succeeded in banishing previously widespread supply problems with PPE.“Lack of personal protective equipment continues to be a critical issue. It is heartbreaking to hear that some staff have been told to simply ‘hold their breath’ due to lack of masks,” said Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, the president of the Doctors’ Association UK (DAUK).“Doctors are dying. Nurses are dying. We are devastated, and can no longer stand by and watch as more dedicated colleagues lose their life,” she said.At least three NHS doctors, two nurses and one midwife have died already after contracting coronavirus.The DAUK has begun collating anonymous reports from its network of frontline medics about continuing shortages of PPE, which has created confusion, alarm and fear among staff. It has developed an app with a firm called Messly to log shortages.Based on 500 reports so far from 193 hospital trusts and GP practices, the DAUK says that:72% of doctors cannot get hold of an FFP3 mask when they need one.77% report shortages of long-sleeved gowns.43% cannot always use a visor or goggles when they need them.The findings also indicate that protective kit is still in short supply for doctors undertaking “aerosol generating procedures” on Covid-19 patients, such as intubating them, where potentially dangerous droplets are expelled from their mouths.Almost half (49%) of medics performing such procedures cannot always access a gown, 42% an FFP3 mask and 20% proper eye protection, DAUK found.However, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) said a combination of revised PPE guidance issued last week by Public Health England, and the NHS drive to get millions more pieces of kit to the frontline, had made a big impact on the shortages and helped allay staff’s fears.“Things are much better than they were a week ago. People on the ground are saying that it’s getting better, though there are still some distribution issues within hospitals,” said Dr Andrew Goddard, president of the RCP, which represents mainly hospital doctors in England.Public Health England’s “much clearer” new advice had helped banish the “confusion” many staff felt about what PPE they should wear in certain medical settings in order to reduce their risk, he added.“In a survey we ran last week, 22% of staff said they didn’t have access to the PPE they needed,” he said.“That is adding to the anxiety and emotional challenge of working in these settings, as working on Covid wards is a scary situation. That 22% needs to become 0% as soon as possible.”The Twickenham MP Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokeswoman, said: “It is absolutely shocking to hear from medical professionals about the risks they are having to take in providing care for our loved ones and the fear they have of speaking up regarding the availability of appropriate PPE.“Despite promises from ministers, it’s clear that our frontline health and care workforce still do not have adequate supplies of the correct protective equipment.“It is simply unacceptable that so many staff feel they are being put in harm’s way due to shortages of essential kit, in turn risking the health of their loved ones and other patients. They should not need to rely on crowdfunding, donations from schools and makeshift visors to do these critical roles.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We are working around the clock to give the NHS, social care and other public services the equipment and support they need to tackle this outbreak.“Over the weekend we delivered over 34 million pieces of PPE to NHS trusts in England, including over 8.8 million aprons, and 7 million face masks, and we have created a 24-hour hotline which NHS Trusts can call to raise any supply issues.”A separate survey by the British Medical Association (BMA) also found that doctors working in high-risk environments with Covid-positive patients are finding it hard to get the right PPE.Its survey of over 1,500 medics found that more than half working in such settings reported a lack of face masks, while 65% could not get adequate eye protection. Over half (56%) said they felt pressurised to work in areas involving higher risk of infection despite a shortage of PPE.One hospital doctor told the BMA: “The quality of our eye protection and apron is useless. Some of the PPE provided feels like a tick-box exercise just for psychological reassurance.”And one GP said: “I feel betrayed by the government who are not transparent enough to say that they do not have the ideal supplies and therefore are asking us to put ourselves in harm’s way with suboptimal protection.”"

 Coronavirus will thrive in British jails: prisoners face a death sentence ","So you’re locked down and you’re a bit scared, but you’re safe. George is 70 years old and he’s locked up. He has served two years of an eight-year sentence and is expecting to be released by 2022. If he lives that long. He had no idea when they put him inside that fraud could carry the death penalty but that’s what he’s facing now. Because George is one of the 2,000 prisoners already identified by justice secretary Robert Buckland as having an underlying health issue that, were they in the wider community, would require shielding.But in jail his safety is outside his control. Any prison officer – many of whom are still pleading for PPE – can come in and out of his cell, and there’s nothing he can do about it. His wing has been designated the isolation wing for prisoners with Covid-19, so he knows he’s in close contact with the virus: in fact, prisoners who have tested positive are frequently sharing cells with those who have not. Try observing social distancing in a cell that was only ever built for one person.If you’re releasing prisoners into the community, you need a solid support networkTo say that George is terrified every time the door opens is an understatement. He’s now in his cell for more than 23 hours a day, with less than an hour to walk around the yard, and there’s no education, no library, no gym, no recreation and no access to information. That leaves only fear. He’s one of the forgotten. Detained by the state, which has a duty to keep him safe. Instead, it threatens his life because jail, even more so than its upmarket cousin the cruise ship, is a petri dish for infection.Latest ministry of justice figures show three deaths, and a 20% increase in cases of the virus in three days (from Thursday to Sunday) to 107 prisoners across 38 prisons and 19 staff across 12 prisons, and that’s with patchy testing. There could be 800 avoidable deaths in prison, University College London’s department of epidemiology has estimated, unless vulnerable inmates are effectively cocooned: a conservative figure compared with the justice minister’s own estimate of 2,000.The government has shown no concern for the acute distress caused by the fact that the greatest number of prisoners ever are guarded by the fewest staff ever. It has been indifferent to the record number of assaults, self-harm, ambulance call-outs, suicides and other deaths in custody. By whatever measure you like, the government, led by the media venom towards a small group of terrorist offenders, has spent a decade making things worse.There’s only one right thing to do with George and that’s release him. He’s 70 and he’s not a danger. There are many thousands of prisoners like George and it’s time for them to be let out.And now, thanks to Covid-19, the government has bowed to universal pressure. Pregnant prisoners are out and those with weeks of their sentence to go will soon be leaving. And last week ministers announced that 4,000 offenders in England and Wales could be “temporarily released” .But these measures will not be enough to halt the spread of coronavirus in a prison estate of 83,000. What’s needed is a massive reduction in the prison population. And when prison numbers are finally down, let’s keep them down. If prisons are kept for the most dangerous, it would result in jails that are actually less dangerous and better managed, and that means, yes, less reoffending.George has two years left, so his release isn’t even on the cards yet. Surely the 1,700 prisoners over 70 years old must be the next to leave? Although he doesn’t have anywhere to go, which used to mean sleeping rough or going to a shelter. Now, thanks to the pandemic, local authorities are housing the homeless, providing hotels and university halls to stop them spreading viruses on the streets.However it’s not that straightforward. A lot of people think that all you have to do for the homeless is give them a bed. This doesn’t recognise the mixture of addiction, mental health issues and poverty that lie behind homelessness – and a lot of prison sentences too. If you’re releasing prisoners into the community, you need a solid support network. It’s unfortunate, then, that these prisoners, with their complex needs, will be released at a time when those support services are contracting dramatically.For this sector, support has always been face to face. Now, the drop-in centres where food and help was once available aren’t there. Offender management is no longer about two people in a room. The internet and call centres are a means of communication incompatible with poverty, where there’s no access to phones, data or sim cards. You’re on a probation order and you don’t know where or how or when you should be reporting. You live in fear of a breach, but you have no way of communicating. What about the addicted who are trying to get clean and live the 12-step programme? They can’t join online meetings if they don’t have the tech.There’s only one solution: money, free phones and wifi. After all, the government has been quick enough to hand it out to businesses and airlines, so let’s have it for the unheard poor.Why must it take Covid-19 for the government to stop pursuing its relentless, uncaring, punitive policies and do the right thing? We won’t forget.• Mark Johnson is founder and chief executive of User Voice, a charity that works in prisons and the community"

There will also have been general plans that would have been refined over the last few days since the prime minister’s illness became clear.”As the UK is a parliamentary democracy, there is no need, under the UK’s unwritten constitution, for an election in order for Raab to assume prime ministerial powers. However, political pressure could eventually lead to one.If the prime minister remains incapacitated for some time, questions will be raised about whether Raab has the authority to continue, Kerslake told the Guardian, and the cabinet may intervene.“The question will be to what extent can Raab carry the authority that Boris Johnson had, given that Boris led the government to a general election victory. I think a lot now depends on how quickly the PM recovers.“If he doesn’t recover quickly, the cabinet would take a view on who would be prime minister. But if the prime minister was unable to continue, the Conservative party may have to choose a new leader,” he said.“The challenge is that there are big questions to be made now. When and how do we leave the lockdown? Do we intensify it in the short term? Are we going to deliver the increased levels of testing and PPE [personal protection equipment] needed? Do we need to do more to protect those caught up in the economic fallout of the lockdown, such as the younger and the lower-paid?”Last month, the prime minister’s spokesman said if Johnson was unwell and unable to work, Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. Downing Street is said to have drawn up plans to ensure the continuation of government in all circumstances but details have not been divulged publicly.Ian Duncan Smith, the former Conservative party leader and a friend of the prime minister, said he had “all the confidence” in Raab as he was surrounded by cabinet ministers who knew the processes around the prime minister. He said contingencies for this situation were well planned.“In terms of the government we shouldn’t have any concerns at all. It has been known for some considerable time that the prime minister appointed Dominic Raab as first secretary. He is more than capable of fulfilling this role and he has great experience in government,” he told BBC News.“And he would have been brought up to speed on all the key processes that go around the prime minister since he became ill because they would have been planning for this and just in case this happened.“All the other cabinet ministers, some very senior like Michael Gove who understand how this works, they’ve all got important jobs to do … but what they will now have to do is look to Dominic Raab for that final principal decision making process whilst the prime minister is unable to take that role.”"

And it’s probably the number one concern for health workers around the country at the moment.Guardian Australia has previously reported fears of shortages of PPE in the health system as the number of cases of Covid-19 rises across Australia. Rural Aboriginal medical services in particular face a “catastrophic” shortage.Monday’s Q+A, dedicated to the experiences of frontline healthcare workers, revealed significant concern among doctors about the shortage.Vyom Sharma, a general practitioner from Victoria, said his practice was down to about 10 surgical masks and suggested the federal government should have done more to source supplies sooner.“We’re trying to save them for when we really need them,” he said.“And the concern is it’s actually affecting the nature of care we can provide. We are transitioning to telehealth at the moment, offering face-to-face consultations when required. But they have to be reduced in a way that’s commensurate to the supply we have available.“It’s correct what Steven [Parnis] said, we’re very worried about the lack of personal protective equipment and it’s been affecting the care we’ve been offering patients throughout. When the criteria for Covid-19 had been changing gradually through February and March, a huge percentage of my population were overseas students and travellers and tourists.“And you’re rationing masks even then. And there are people coughing and sneezing one day who come from South Korea or Italy and a few day later the criteria changes and it says these people are high risk and you wonder ‘should I have used a mask on them and I would have if I had enough’.”Lucy Morgan, a respiratory physician from Sydney’s Nepean hospital, said she was “reassured” by work done to supply public hospitals with PPE as the number of Covid-19 cases began to quickly escalate in March. But, she said, healthcare workers in other areas including GPs and specialists in private practice could find it harder to source equipment.“Their access to protective gear is a little bit less secure. I think they have, they haven’t got the same bargaining power or purchasing power that hospitals or health departments have. And I think that’s another challenge for us,” she said.Also on Monday, shadow minister for health Chris Bowen criticised the Ruby Princess fiasco after the death of a 12th former passenger of the cruise ship.“There has to be a full explanation to the Australian people about how Border Force let that happen. It is just unacceptable.”Liberal MP Katie Allen said she was pleased that New South Wales police commissioner Mick Fuller had launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess case “so that we can get to the bottom of actually what happened”.A former medical researcher, Allen said the government had been increasing hospital capacity in preparation for more cases of the virus.“As a government, we’re being very careful about looking at ventilator capacity and we’re also bringing more nurses online because those intensive care beds need 24-hour care and we do need more nurses,” she said.“[We are] bringing more people into the workforce to make sure we’re ready for a possibility that may actually not actually eventuate but we need to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.”"

 Ruffled Raab gives little clue of true state of prime minister's health ","Just about the only reassuring thing to come out of the latest Downing Street press conference was that Dominic Raab does not yet have his hands on the nuclear button.Because in almost every other respect the foreign secretary appeared to be cosplaying Peter Sellers in Dr Strangelove. A man so clinically unstable he has yet to realise he is by far the most dangerous person in any room he enters.The pathology manifests itself in different ways. Often Raab is a ball of barely repressed anger, the vein on this forehead throbbing metronomically as he tries to front out any tricky questions.Today, he was going for the more laid-back approach – the Mr Nice Guy who definitely had no guilty secrets. Unfortunately for him, he had more to hide than the usual collection of unsolved murders. Sooner or later, someone is going to have to have a quiet word with Dom and tell him he’s crap at this gig. Then so is almost everyone else in the cabinet.To be fair, Dom had been dealt a particularly bad hand. After the usual disclaimers about the government having done a generally brilliant job so far, the foreign secretary was rather obliged to give an update on the prime minister’s health.Something he tried to mumble away as an afterthought. Boris Johnson was in top form, excellent spirits. In fact, he was having such a good time running the country from his bed in St Thomas’ hospital that he was planning to extend his stay to an extra night.There was basically nothing wrong with Boris, was the message. He’d just dropped in to hospital because he was getting a bit bored at home.Understandably, no one was particularly convinced by Raab’s “He’s in good spirits” explanation of the prime minister’s health. After all, most people who have had even a mild version of the coronavirus have reported they were whacked out for the best part of a week and good for next to nothing.Yet here was Raab trying to persuade us that despite having a high temperature, a cough and breathing difficulties, Johnson was on top form and fit for anything. Being prime minister was actually a piece of piss that anyone could do from hospital. No big deal. “He’s in good spirits,” Raab again repeated, his eyes darting anxiously around the room. Mr Cool was now looking decidedly ruffled and he inadvertently let slip the truth. The last time he had actually spoken to the prime minister was on Saturday, the day before Boris was admitted to hospital.So we were asked to accept that for the last two days he had been entirely out of the loop and that Boris had been running the show on his own. Not necessarily bad news for the country, but badly credible.There was only one inescapable conclusion. That Boris doesn’t rate either Raab or Michael Gove as suitable deputies to run the country in his absence and reckons that he could probably still do a better job than either of them from his hospital bed. It’s a lack of trust with which most of the country has some sympathy.Occasionally, Raab would desperately look to the newly recovered chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the Foreign Office deputy chief medical adviser, Angela McLean, for reassurance. Which they both refused to give. Though the nation was pleased to see him back, Whitty rather looked as if he would be elsewhere. Probably visiting his second home, like the Scottish chief medical officer. That way he would have to resign and wouldn’t have to put himself through any more of these excruciating press conferences.Long before the end, Raab had managed to muddle up even the most basic of messages. Last week, both Boris and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had offered a glimmer of hope with a lockdown exit strategy, involving arm bands and antibody test. All that was now long forgotten as Dom pointed to some slides that showed it was far too early to be making any of those kinds of predictions. We were going backwards fast.A consistent display in hopelessness by the hopeless. A briefing that had only served to muddy the waters further: the Queen’s call for national unity a distant memory. For what came through clearest was that no one in government really had a clue what was happening. Even the de facto prime minister wasn’t being informed about the prime minister’s condition.Within hours the mirage had dropped. The press conference a total irrelevance. What Dom had or hadn’t known was immaterial. During the afternoon Boris’s condition had worsened and he was being transferred to intensive care. Dom was now acting prime minister. All that anyone could do now was put their trust in the doctors and pray for the best. The crisis had just got significantly worse."

Oxygen was available through a mask on the ward he was admitted to on Sunday, but the move to intensive care on Monday strongly suggests that was not enough to help him with the breathing problems caused by the viral pneumonia that the virus triggers.Most people in intensive care, according to the World Health Organization, require ventilation. Around 15% of people with Covid-19 become seriously ill and need oxygen therapy in hospital. A further 5% are moved into intensive care, so that their breathing can be taken over by mechanical ventilation. Some will also need support for other organs.Anyone who is put on a ventilator will need to be sedated, although they are not unconscious. A tube must be inserted into the patient’s windpipe, so that air and oxygen from the machine can be blown into the lungs. That takes the strain off the lungs while they recover.Johnson, 55, is said to have been admitted to intensive care in case he should need ventilation, but 63% of those admitted to ICUs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are ventilated within the first 24 hours. Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) say that critical care treatment for Covid-19 should be started “with a clear plan of how the treatment will address the diagnosis and lead to agreed treatment goals (outcomes)”.Ventilation is vital in most severe Covid-19 cases, which is why there has been a huge effort to obtain more machines and even encourage engineering businesses to switch production lines to make them.In the severest cases, patients are put on an ECMO machine (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), which can support both the heart and lungs where somebody is in a life-threatening condition.Johnson’s admission to intensive care comes shortly after the 10th day of the illness, which has been identified as a real danger point. During the first week, most people’s immune systems rally and manage to fight off the virus. Those who do not recover and continue to struggle for breath and have a fever often need help around the middle of the second week.In that second week, the immune system can sometimes go into overdrive. In its attempt to fight the virus, it creates what is called a cytokine storm, in which the immune system attacks the body’s own organs. The heart, the liver and kidneys are most likely to be affected and all of them can need to be supported by machines that can take over their function.The latest report into patients admitted into critical care so far from the intensive care national audit and research centre (IANARC), showed 2,621 admissions up to 3 April, most of whom are still there. The mean age was 60 and 73% of them were men. More than 35% of them were overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 30, and 37% were obese.Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London, said: “It seems clear that the prime minister went to hospital because he had difficulty breathing. It seems he was initially put on oxygen, and was conscious.“But as often happens with Covid-19, his condition has now deteriorated so he has been admitted to intensive care.“We understand the PM is on a type of breathing support called Continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap), which is commonly used in treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea. Experience in Italy and other European countries has shown that Cpap can be effective in Covid-19 patients, at least initially. Many Covid-19 patients progress to invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves a tube being put down the patient’s airway.”"

He describes mild symptoms for 24 hours including a temperature. He says that he will continue to lead the government.Saturday 28 MarchSecretary of state for business Alok Sharma tells reporters: “Can I be absolutely clear the PM has had mild symptoms, he is absolutely leading the response from the front.”Monday 30 MarchJohnson chairs cabinet by remote video link. But newspapers later report that Downing Street sources say Johnson has been “coughing and spluttering his way through conference calls”.Wednesday 1 AprilJohnson posts a video, urging people to stay at home and saying that those with symptoms like his should stay at home. He says that “although I am sequestered … I am able to be in constant touch with my officials” and says he is “absolutely confident” we will beat it together.Thursday 2 AprilWhen asked if the prime minister had a temperature, a Downing Street spokesman says only that he continues to have “mild symptoms”. Johnson appears on the steps of No 11 Downing Street – where his apartment is - to join the second “Clap for our Carers” event. Some observers suggest that Johnson looks unwell in pictures. Aides say he will be coming out of self-isolation on Friday.Friday 3 AprilJohnson is unable to leave quarantine after seven days of self-isolation because he still has a persistent temperature. He posts a video on Twitter saying that although he is feeling better “in accordance with government advice I must continue to self-isolate”. But he says that he continues to work.Lobby correspondents are told Johnson had only mild symptoms of the illness and that he chaired the morning coronavirus meeting with ministers and officials.Saturday 4 AprilJohnson’s pregnant partner Carrie Symonds reveals that she has had the main symptoms of coronavirus for the past week but is “on the mend”. It is reported that Johnson is “stubbornly refusing to stop working”, with the Mail on Sunday reporting a source as saying: “He has not been resting enough and is still leading from the front. Obviously that is beginning to slow down his recovery. He needs to go to bed.”Sunday 5 AprilHealth secretary Matt Hancock tells Sky News: “He’s OK. I’ve been talking to him every day, several times a day … he’s very much got his hand on the tiller. But he’s still got a temperature … He’s working away inside Downing Street. He’s in good spirits.”But later Downing Street says that Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests “as a precautionary step” because his symptoms are persistent 10 days after he tested positive.Monday 6 AprilMorningCabinet minister Robert Jenrick tells BBC Breakfast: “We all hope and expect that he can get back to No 10 very soon.”A government spokesman says that the prime minister is in “good spirits” while continuing to work on his red box of government papers.Asked whether Johnson had pneumonia, the spokesman says that any change in his condition would be communicated to the public. But he acknowledges that the prime minister continues to have a cough and a temperature 11 days after first reporting symptoms.AfternoonA tweet from Johnson’s account says that he has gone into hospital for routine tests “as I’m still experiencing coronavirus symptoms”. It goes on: “I’m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe.”At the daily press briefing, foreign secretary Dominic Raab says that the prime minister is “still in charge” from his hospital bed. He adds: “He was admitted as a precaution only as because some of his symptoms have persisted. He is in good spirits and is still in charge of the government.“He is being given regular updates on developments and he continues to lead the government.” Raab acknowledges that he has not spoken to Johnson since Saturday.At the same briefing, chief medical officer Chris Whitty is asked if Johnson could have pneumonia. He says: “This is a question for him and his medical advisers, who are outstanding. I am absolutely not going to discuss any individual patient and I do not have the full details, nor should I.”EveningDowning Street issues a statement saying that the prime minister’s condition has “worsened” over the course of the afternoon. It continues: “On the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital.”Raab is asked to deputise for him where necessary, the statement says. It notes that Johnson is receiving “excellent care”."

He remained conscious on Monday night.A No 10 spokesman said: “Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital.“The prime minister has asked foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is the first secretary of state, to deputise for him where necessary. The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication.”Intensive care beds are reserved for those who are very ill, and in the case of Covid-19, often those who need to be put on a mechanical ventilator to help them breathe. Since first being admitted to St Thomas’ on Sunday evening, Johnson, 55, is understood to have received oxygen through a non-invasive mask only.His pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds – herself recovering from coronavirus symptoms – was said to be deeply anxious about Johnson’s condition.News of his hospitalisation, 11 days after he developed a cough and high temperature, caused national and international concern, with world leaders from US president Donald Trump to French president Emmanuel Macron sending their best wishes and support for Johnson’s recovery.Trump said: “We’re very saddened to hear that [Johnson] was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery. He’s been a really good friend. He’s been really something very special: strong resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up.”He said he had asked two companies offering treatment for coronavirus to contact London “immediately”. “They’ve really advanced therapeutics ... and they have arrived in London already, the London office has whatever they need. We’ll see if we can be of help. We’ve contacted all of Boris’s doctors, and we’ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go.”Shortly after the announcement, Raab appeared on the airwaves with an attempt to reassure the public, saying government business would continue. He told the BBC there was an “incredibly strong team spirit” behind Johnson and that ministers would focus on delivering the plans he had put in place.He said the prime minister was in safe hands and receiving excellent care and vowed that the government would bring the whole country through the pandemic. Buckingham Palace said of the Queen: “Her Majesty has been kept informed by No 10.”The decision to hand over power to Raab, 46, was taken after concern in the cabinet and among MPs that Johnson should have been resting instead of working. It also comes amid suggestions that the seriousness of the prime minster’s coronavirus symptoms – including a persistent cough and high temperature - were being underplayed by himself and his aides.At midday on Monday, Downing Street was still insisting that the prime minister was able to read his red box of government papers, and at the daily 5pm press conference, Raab claimed Johnson was still fully in charge and issuing instructions.No 10 had insisted earlier on Monday that Johnson was only in hospital as a “precautionary measure” and for “routine tests”, having said up until his admission on Sunday evening that he was suffering from mild symptoms.Claims that his condition had not deteriorated came under increased scrutiny after it emerged that a bed at St Thomas’ was being prepared for Johnson as early as Thursday last week. He spent Sunday night on an empty wing that is normally used for elective procedures, a source said, before being moved to intensive care on Monday evening.Before his move to intensive care, the Guardian was told of frustration among ministers over Johnson remaining in charge for so long rather than resting, even after he had received oxygen treatment having failed to shake off Covid-19 symptoms for 11 days.It came as the UK death toll from coronavirus exceeded 5,000 for the first time, rising by 439 to 5,373. The daily reported increase fell for the second day in a row, but a Department of Health source cautioned that this can be due to lower reporting at weekends and said the trend needs to be lower during the week to be a cause for optimism.At the daily Downing Street press conference at 5pm, Raab said it remained the case that Johnson was “in charge, he is leading and giving instructions as and when required”.However, he later admitted not having spoken to Johnson since Saturday – the day before the prime minister’s admission to hospital on medical advice.No 10 insisted it had been “transparent throughout” about Johnson’s medical condition, despite having claimed up until the point of his hospital admission that his symptoms were “mild”. His spokesman dropped that description on Monday, saying instead that his cough and temperature were “persistent”. Two ministers, James Duddridge and Nadine Dorries, suggested Johnson needed time to recuperate. Duddridge said it was important for the prime minister to now “rest, look after yourself and let the others do the heavy [lifting]”.But Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and a friend of the prime minister, said he had good reasons for not wanting to step away until now.He told the BBC: “His first thought has not actually been for himself, it has been in a sense for the British people. He doesn’t want the British people to feel in any way overly concerned and worried. He wants them to be calm, which goes to the nature of the individual he is.”Duncan Smith also attempted to calm fears around Johnson’s admission, saying the public “shouldn’t over-read the going into intensive care”.“I am certain that the doctors will have done this to make sure that they can stabilise him completely so they can treat whatever he may have. As I say, he may have a strong secondary infection which needs to be treated and treated rather urgently,” he said.After the prime minister’s hospital admission, Raab led the daily coronavirus morning meeting, known internally as the “war cabinet”. But several cabinet sources said there was a worry that Johnson’s refusal to let go of power had been causing impotence at the top of government.Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s most senior adviser, is also isolating with coronavirus symptoms and has not yet returned to work.While the prime minister has been in self-isolation for over a week, reported tensions between Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, emerged over the competing demands of the health impacts of coronavirus and its effects on the economy. Tory sources insisted any problems were largely at the level of officials.Meanwhile, No 10 and the Department of Health have been frustrated with both NHS England, for allegedly failing to share data quickly enough at “sit-rep” [situation reports] meetings on the state of services, and Public Health England, for not agreeing to look to private firms for outside testing capacity quickly enough.Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, also said it was “too early” and a “mistake” to have a “serious discussion about all the things we need to do step-by-step to move to the next phase of managing this” without the UK having seen a peak in cases.He also stressed the government would need to balance many factors in deciding whether to ease the lockdown. These include people dying directly from the virus itself, dying indirectly if the NHS became overwhelmed with cases, the effects of postponing other types of healthcare because of coronavirus, and the long-term health impact on people due to social and economic reasons."

An article in the British Medical Journal also urges us to “lower the baseline”, reducing other demands on health systems to allow resources to be focused on the epidemic. Examples include reduced speed limits, as introduced on the Isle of Man, while UK traffic is back at levels last seen in the 1950s and wider lockdown measures may have averted a serious smog at the end of March. But we should do more.Residents of British Columbia have been told to stop outdoor fires. UK local councils are also urging people not to have bonfires to dispose of rubbish and recycling as they stay at home and get on with spring cleaning and tidying gardens. Bonfire smoke can enter homes of vulnerable people who have to stay indoors. Brighton and Hove council has also appealed for people to stop using fireplaces and stoves.

The suggestion made by a source was specific: a bed was being prepared at St Thomas’ hospital for the prime minister, whose condition had worsened during his seven-day period of isolation in Downing Street.It did not take long for rumours to spread. A Conservative backbencher had heard a similar story, this time suggesting Johnson may have even already been admitted to the hospital across the Thames from Westminster, and passed the tip to the Guardian at about the same time. Together it was more than enough to prompt an urgent inquiry to No 10.In reply, Johnson’s aides were emphatic. His condition had not deteriorated, he still had only “mild symptoms”, he hoped to be at work from Friday when his coronavirus isolation period was up - and he had not been admitted to St Thomas’ hospital for treatment. When on Monday evening it emerged that contrary to reassurances about him getting on with his red box, he was being admitted to intensive care, the denials were coming under increasing scrutiny.Johnson, 55, had spent the week since testing positive for coronavirus holed up in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, while his pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds - who has herself been unwell - was becoming increasingly concerned about his health.The prime minister hoped to keep his period of isolation to a minimum, trying to govern the country via video conference calls and email, all the while still coughing and with his overall condition failing to improve.Meanwhile, the mood in Downing Street was darkening during a difficult week in which it was becoming clear that the government was struggling to hit a target of 10,000 coronavirus tests a day, even prompting the unwell prime minister on Wednesday to promise that he would take personal charge of the issue.Key advisers such as Dominic Cummings, his chief aide, were not at No 10 because they too were ill and isolating, while criticism was being levelled at the health secretary, Matt Hancock, himself only back at work on Thursday after developing symptoms.“Other ministers feel he’s been getting the government in trouble by over-promising on testing, and not interrogating his civil servants enough,” according to one well-connected Tory aide, who is close to key figures at No 10.There was also criticism of the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, the leading figure in Downing Street in Johnson’s and Cummings’s absence. “Sedwill seems to be amassing power, even though you have to be questioning how effective the civil service has been in tackling coronavirus so far. And all the while, was he looking out properly for the prime minister?” the aide added, although it is hard to know if even the country’s most senior official could have persuaded Johnson to recuperate earlier.On Thursday lunchtime, having denied the first round of rumours about St Thomas’, Downing Street floated the idea that Johnson might not be back at work on Friday as planned if his temperature remained high.A cough was not mentioned, but his official spokesman told a daily briefing with journalists that he would only go back to work the next day if his temperature came down.That evening at 8pm, despite his isolation, the prime minister appeared at the door of No 10 to applaud the work of NHS workers. Despite the appearance, the health rumours did not go away: St Thomas’ was on standby because Johnson’s condition had worsened, the first source insisted - only for Downing Street, when pressed, to deny that he was about to be admitted that night.On Friday lunchtime, the situation began to unravel. An unkempt, gravelly-voiced and clearly unwell Johnson released a video in which he said, somewhat implausibly, “I’m feeling better,” before conceding he could not fully return to work. “Alas, I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,” he insisted.On Saturday he spoke to newly elected Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to invite him “to a briefing next week” on the crisis, but on Sunday his health apparently took a turn. At about 7.30pm that evening, Johnson was rushed by car to the hospital.About 90 minutes later, Downing Street went public, saying Johnson had been “admitted to hospital for tests” on the advice of his doctor and, in a change of language, acknowledged the prime minister was suffering from “persistent” rather than mild symptoms.Shortly before 8.30pm on Monday, further news came: the prime minister had been admitted to intensive care at St Thomas’ 90 minutes earlier.Several sources say Johnson has required oxygen to help with his breathing following his admission to hospital - an assertion that was not denied by Downing Street - although his official spokesman said that Russian reports that he was on a ventilator were “disinformation”. Those who know Symonds, 32, say she is worried: “She’s ringing up friends, telling them how anxious she is.”At the daily press briefing on Monday evening, nearly 24 hours after Johnson’s admission to hospital, little extra detail was offered.Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who has now taken over temporarily with Johnson incapacitated, would only repeat that the prime minister “had a comfortable night” and was “in good spirits”.Some Conservative MPs are worried that Downing Street’s evasiveness on the seriousness of the prime minister’s condition will undermine trust in what they say going forward."
"84","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/california-prisons-older-inmates-coronavirus","2020-04-06T16:00:09-0400","  California urged to release older prisoners amid coronavirus, including violent offenders ","As the coronavirus rages through prisons and jails across the United States, attorneys, advocates and family members of California inmates are urging the state to release older prisoners and inmates with underlying health conditions for whom contracting the virus could have devastating consequences.In response to the coronavirus threat, California has already fast tracked the release of almost 3,500 people serving sentences for nonviolent offenses who were due to be paroled in the next 60 days. The California Department for Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) has also taken coronavirus mitigation efforts like barring visitors, increasing facility cleaning and producing hand sanitizer.But cohorts of prosecutors, doctors and criminal justice reformers are calling on state officials to step up their relief efforts for older and vulnerable prisoners, including those serving time for violent offenses.Alicia Rhoden’s husband, Bruce Wayne Rhoden, who is serving the final year of a four-year sentence in Wasco state prison for assault with a deadly weapon, also has several violent and drug felony charges dating back to the early 1990s. In addition to his age, Bruce has a bevy of pre-existing conditions, including diabetes and HIV, that make him vulnerable to severe illness and death if infected with the coronavirus. Alicia, who’s 60 and has epilepsy, says she’s frightened that her husband will become ill while in prison and she won’t know until it’s too late.“My husband is 61 and his health isn’t good at all,” Alicia Rhoden, a Los Angeles resident, said. “My fear is that he can die in prison because of his medical conditions.”“He needs a lot of care,” she added. “He takes six insulin shots a day and needs his antivirals.”Hoping to force the state to focus relief efforts on sick incarcerated people and those over 50, attorneys with the Prison Law Office and Rosen, Bien, Galvan & Grunfeld sought to modify an existing court order that mandates California to reduce its prison population.“Excluding lifers who have served long periods of time and people with violent offenses is a waste of human life,” said Michael Bien, one of attorneys who filed the emergency motion. “People make horrible mistakes but how many years must someone stay in a dangerous situation to make up for the horrible mistake?”Over the weekend, a three-judge panel denied the emergency motion. According to the written decision, the judges agreed that the state must act swiftly, but that the original prison reduction order “was never intended to prepare Defendants to confront this unprecedented pandemic” and could therefore not be modified in light of the coronavirus.Now, Bien says his office and the Prison Law Office will take the motion to a single judge and seek an order to transfer high-risk people out of prisons and into empty state facilities or home confinement in lieu of full releases.“The best outcome isn’t a victory in court but a victory in reducing density. We’re hoping this message to the governors’ office is taken seriously,” said Bien.As of 5 April, 16 inmates and 53 staff members at the CDCR have tested positive for Covid-19. While that number is small compared to the 48 cases and one death in a single Illinois prison and the nearly 200 cases at Rikers Island in New York, advocates worry that it’s just a matter of time before prisons in California see dozens of confirmed cases.The CDCR houses around 116,000 inmates in prisons and camps, according to their most recent population report. Almost 5,600 are 65 or older and 37% of the total prison population have at least one of the risk factors that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says put them at risk of severe illness from Covid-19.Age and underlying conditions combined with the lack of space in prisons are a “perfect storm of why this population should be released early”, said David Muhammad, the executive director of the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform, of older prisoners.“They’re most at risk, they cost the most to incarcerate and care for, and have the lowest risk of recidivating,” Muhammad continued. (Federal inmates who were released after the age of 60 had a less than 10% reincarceration rate compared to over 30% for people under 30, according to a 2017 United States Sentencing Commission report.)In a 31 March response to Bien’s motion, attorneys for the state say CDCR officials have “already taken immediate, bold and appropriate steps in response to this rapidly evolving crisis”. The measures include moving around 500 people from dormitories, which are open spaces with bunk beds that hold dozens of inmates, to prisons with available space. They’ve also suspended intake from county jails, a process that usually brings 3,000 new people into the CDCR’s 35 adult institutions per month.A spokesperson for the CDCR told the Guardian in an email that these steps along with the recent releases will, “help create physical distancing for all inmates, thereby reducing the risk of spread of Covid-19 among the entire population”.But many worry that the state’s exclusion of people who have committed violent crimes – almost half of the CDCR population according to a 2018 department report – won’t reduce the elderly population enough to avoid an outbreak.“It’s a risk to public safety if you don’t reduce the population, not the other way around,” said Adnan Khan, who after spending 16 years in San Quentin state prison became the executive director of justice reform not-for-profit Re:Store Justice.Khan, who was released in January 2019, says he stays in daily contact with friends that are still incarcerated, including his 68-year-old mentor. Khan recalls a recent conversation where his mentor matter of factly told Khan that he and other prisoners are, “Just waiting to get the coronavirus. Those who survive do, and those who don’t, don’t.”State officials say that releasing people from incarceration is a complicated process that begins more than six months before someone is allowed to walk out the prison’s gates. This process includes assessing post-release needs and getting people set up with state-funded benefits as needed. They argue that these pre-release plans are necessary to ensure that people can thrive post-incarceration and that this process should remain in the hands of corrections officials, not state courts.Still, people like Khan and Rhoden worry that as the legal battle wears on, their loved ones will become more at risk while behind bars.“My mom’s not young, and I’m worried about her getting sick there,” said Tamisha Torres, a re-entry service provider in California’s Contra Costa county.Torres’ mother is 55 years old and incarcerated in Folsom state prison, about 30 miles from Sacramento, after hitting a California Highway Patrol officer while he was helping with a collision. She was accepted into one of the CDCR’s 3 Alternative Custody Programs, which are private residences or CDCR facilities with rehabilitative programs, to serve the rest of her sentence. But the rapid spread of coronavirus has prompted CDCR officials to stop the transfer of the people from prisons to these facilities. So Torres’ mother is continuing to work in the prison while she awaits her transfer.This is a harsh lesson for all of us on how dangerous our systems are“It’s devastating when you get a notice that you’re gonna be released and then it’s like ‘Oops sorry, the bus isn’t coming’,” said Torres.“Now my mom has to decide: ‘Am I going to go to work and risk getting sick in this place or am I not gonna have what I need to be comfortable here?’ If you’re in prison and don’t have someone taking care of you then going to work and getting that 35 cents an hour is everything,” Torres continued.“One of my concerns is my husband getting sick and no one telling me. I just find out that he’s dead, it gives me fear – that I might not know,” said Rhoden.“And Bruce gets frightened because he doesn’t know if something happened to me. I’m epileptic and have 10 seizures a week.

 Rolls-Royce's self-reliance has given the chancellor a boost ","Rishi Sunak will be delighted. The chancellor told the aviation industry that government-backed bailouts would only be considered “as a last resort”, and here comes engine-maker Rolls-Royce to demonstrate what it can achieve under its own steam.Rolls’ shareholders should also be pleased. Monday’s dividend suspension is bad news for them, but not half as bad as a rights issue would have been. The latter was avoided (at least for now). Instead, investors got a reassuring display of the company’s ability to absorb financial pain by borrowing more and spending less.Rolls has drawn down one £2.5bn credit facility and secured a £1.5bn one on top, bringing its overall liquidity to £6.7bn. The cash drag in the other direction is severe, which is only to be expected given that Rolls collected £3.9bn in 2019 via “engine flying hours” (EFH) contracts. With so many planes not flying, the plunge in the EFH line in March was 50%; April’s rate will be worse.Direct cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to £2,500 a month. There are similar wage subsidies for employees.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.Add it all up, though, and City analysts reckon any financial crisis at Rolls would not appear until the autumn. Remember that two smaller divisions – defence and power systems – are carrying on as normal. And Rolls reckons it can ease its cashflows by £750m this year by cutting spending, not paying a dividend and forcing a temporary 10% pay cut on workers.The big unknown, of course, is how long airplane fleets will be grounded around the world, and how quickly life will return to normal thereafter. That remains anyone’s guess, and the Rolls chief executive, Warren East, wisely didn’t offer a forecast. But the 18% bounce in the share price tells the story: self-help can keep Rolls’ engine ticking over for a while.They’re an optimistic bunch at Debenhams. As the department store chain headed for administration for the second time within 12 months, management whistled about how lenders are supportive and how normal trading will resume when shoppers are allowed to return to high streets. This latest administration is of the “light touch” variety, apparently, and merely designed to forestall legal action from creditors.One doubts if Debenhams’ suppliers will feel so relaxed since, unlike the last administration, they probably won’t be paid in full this time. Yet, strange as it may sound, Debenhams probably will live to fight another day.Most of the 22,000 staff can be put on the government’s furlough scheme; and, since even mighty Primark isn’t paying its rent, landlords can be told to go whistle for a few months. After another cull of its stores, Debenhams should emerge in vaguely recognisable form.Do not mistake survival for prosperity, however. This is more akin to an exercise in financial damage limitation for Silver Point Capital, the US hedge fund now in control of Debenhams. Covid-19 is a huge setback for its plans, but the hedgies need to roll the dice again, keep the business alive and hope something turns up.As a former Treasury high-flyer, Sir John Kingman knows how to read regulatory breezes. So one suspects Legal & General, where he is chairman, is in the clear on its decision to keep paying a dividend.The Bank of England’s advice to insurers last week was merely to ensure distributions are “prudent and consistent with … risk appetite”. That was a long way from being an outright ban, as was applied to banks. So, as long as it’s being prudent, L&G should be fine.And, yes, L&G is being conservative by most measures. Its last solvency reading was healthy. A large chunk of its business these days is fund management, which doesn’t consume vast sums of capital. And its book of annuities is backed by steady long-life assets.What’s more, there’s a fair argument that putting cash into the hands of investors serves a wider purpose. The money can be recycled and used for rescue fundraisings elsewhere. L&G and Kingman run the risk of being embarrassed if the market shakeout becomes substantially worse, hitting key ratios. But saving the divi looks the right move for now. Someone’s got to give the pension funds some income."

The death toll stood at 9,650.Many hospitals across the US were at capacity, and new hotspots or potential hotspots were springing up in every region. Maps of confirmed cases showed clusters from Atlanta to Nashville to Indianapolis – wherever there was a population center.Trump on Monday morning tweeted “USA strong!” and “Light at the end of the tunnel!” in all capital letters.But new polling by the Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida indicated that voters in the key presidential election battleground state have lost trust in the president. A 53% majority of Floridians in the poll disapproved of Trump’s handling of the crisis, and 58% said they did not trust Trump “to provide reliable information about the coronavirus”.Top administration officials issued a coordinated message at the weekend that the US was facing difficult weeks ahead.“This is probably going to be a very bad week,” Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s foremost infectious diseases expert, said.In New York City, the chair of the city council’s health committee warned the morgues were almost full.“Soon we’ll start ‘temporary interment’,” the councilman, Mark Levine, tweeted. “This likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials (yes you read that right). Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line. It will be done in a dignified, orderly – and temporary – manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take.”Levine later said the plan had not yet been put into motion. Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters: “We will have the capacity for temporary burials – that’s all I’m going to say.“I’m not going into details. I don’t think it’s a great thing to be talking about.”In the state capital, Albany, Andrew Cuomo distanced himself from the idea, saying he would not support such plans.Cuomo, the New York state governor, reported that the coronavirus death toll in the worst hit US state had risen to 4,758 from around 131,000 cases, but added that the daily total of deaths had been “effectively flat for two days”, representing a “possible flattening of the curve” and an apex of the New York outbreak.“If we are plateauing, it is because social distancing is working,” Cuomo said, announcing an extension of the “New York pause” social-distancing guidelines to 29 April, which means schools and non-essential businesses must stay closed until that date.The governor also announced an increase in fines for not observing social distancing and spoke insistently about New Yorkers’ duty to each other and to frontline healthcare professionals.Cuomo said the state government was applying to the Trump administration to have the USNS Comfort, a US navy medical ship docked in New York, converted to taking Covid-19 patients. The temporary hospital set up by the army at the Javits convention centre in Manhattan has already been switched to coronavirus cases.Cuomo also reported “anecdotal suggestions” that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug championed by Trump, was proving effective in clinical trials in the city. But he said definitive answers on the drug’s use in coronavirus cases was “weeks if not months” away.Cuomo also said the New York healthcare system was operating at full stretch but did not for now need any more ventilators, key machines for people badly affected by the respiratory disease.“The people we lost are the people we couldn’t save,” he said.As states continued their struggle to obtain ventilators and other life-saving medical equipment, California governor Gavin Newsom, whose state had some success at fighting off an early wave of the epidemic, said California would loan 500 “state-ownded ventilators” to other states.“It’s more important than ever we are the UNITED States of America,” Newsom tweeted. “I know, if the tables were turned, other states would be there for us.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed tentatively in morning trading, but with millions filing for unemployment each week, a former chair of the federal reserve said the economy could sink into depression.“This is a huge, unprecedented, devastating hit, and my hope is that we will get back to business as quickly as possible,” former chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen told CNBC.But she said the unemployment rate likely was as high as 13% and gross domestic product was down at least 30%."
"88","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/the-guardian-view-on-a-lockdown-exit-strategy-get-plans-in-place","2020-04-06T14:34:29-0400","  The Guardian view on a lockdown exit strategy: get plans in place ","Like pacesetters in a deadly long-distance race, Italy and Spain have for weeks charted new and frightening territory, as the coronavirus pandemic grips Europe. Citizens have watched in anguish, as daily death tolls climbed close to a thousand and hospitals were overwhelmed. At the weekend, nearly a month after Rome and Madrid imposed national lockdowns, the first glimmerings of a reward for an unprecedented period of collective self-restraint were visible. In Italy, Sunday’s reported death toll of 525 was the smallest daily increase since 19 March, and the number of people requiring hospital treatment also fell. In Spain, the growth rate of the number of infections was the lowest since the pandemic began.The uplifting data appears to confirm the positive impact of effective physical distancing on the virus’s spread. Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, is expected to extend the country’s lockdown well beyond its current end date of 13 April, and the government will wait to see the downward trends maintained over a number of days. In Spain, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has already extended the shutdown until 26 April. But the welcome flattening of those dismal curves creates dilemmas and quandaries that are no less daunting for being the result of good news.As Spanish and Italian citizens desperately seek some respite and the spectre of the deepest global recession since the 1930s looms, their politicians’ thoughts are turning to how to manage a loosening of restrictions on people and business, while minimisingthe risk of triggering a second deadly wave.The task, as Mr Speranza says, is to work out a way “to live with the virus” until a vaccine is discovered. Mr Sánchez has indicated that a ban on all non-essential work will be lifted after Easter. Other European countries, including France and Austria, where some shops will reopen next week, have also begun to game-plan the second phase of the crisis. The modus vivendi will, if it is to work, involve continued physical distancing, much greater testing and contact tracing in the community, and a functioning antibody test to establish who has had and recovered from the disease. The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, has emphasised that any easing of the lockdown in France will be “fearsomely complex” and is not likely to happen “in one move everywhere and for everyone”. The politics of easing lockdown will be as fraught and treacherous as imposing it in the first place.As the death rate here continues to rise steeply, ministers are, rightly, preoccupied with reinforcing one stark message: a rigorously observed lockdown for an extended period to come is the only way to save thousands of lives that would otherwise be lost. But as other countries begin to unveil looser measures, the pressure on the government to reveal its own eventual exit strategy will be intense. It must do the necessary groundwork now.The challenges will be multiple: in Germany, scientists have estimated that the current level of 50,000 tests a day – compared with around 10,000 in Britain – would be insufficient to allow even a partial end to lockdown. A system of effective contact tracing will need to be devised. Certain sections of the population will need to be told that they must continue to stay at home. Particular types of businesses may need to be prioritised at the expense of others. In March, the British government was badly behind the curve when it came to moving to a form of lockdown. If it is to maintain the confidence and cooperation of the public in staying at home, it will soon need to offer a credible account of what comes next."
"89","https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-cure-fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-trump","2020-04-06T14:33:37-0400","  Trump touts hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid-19. Don't believe the hype ","Faced with a global coronavirus pandemic that is increasingly centered upon the US, Donald Trump has touted several drugs that he claims can help tackle the outbreak.In March, the US president used a press conference to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine, a common anti-malaria drug, to treat Covid-19, saying: “I sure as hell think we ought to give it a try.”He followed this with a tweet that claimed the use of the drug in combination with azithromycin, an antibiotic, could be “one of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine”. On Sunday Trump again touted hydroxychloroquine, saying “there are some very strong, powerful signs” of its potential as a Covid-19 therapy.Trump has been repeatedly contradicted by public health experts including his own top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, who has warned that there is only “anecdotal evidence” that the drugs could be helpful.Confronted with this disparity Trump, who has repeatedly made false and misleading assertions throughout the coronavirus crisis, responded by telling reporters that “I’m a smart guy” and “I’ve been right a lot”. The Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity have been promoting hydroxychloroquine on their shows.Last week the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided hydroxychloroquine with an “emergency use authorization” to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. State officials in New York have said that about 4,000 seriously ill patients are now being treated with the drug.But with some Americans turning to unconventional, and potentially deadly, treatments for coronavirus, medical experts have called for considered, accurate information to avoid exacerbating the pandemic.Last month an Arizona man died and his wife was left in critical condition after the couple took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is related to the composition of the anti-malaria treatment promoted by Trump.“Trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,” the woman told NBC, before advising: “Don’t take anything. Don’t believe anything. Don’t believe anything that the president says and his people … call your doctor.”Here are the key things to know:Hydroxychloroquine, also known by its brand name, Plaquenil, is a drug used to treat malaria. It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.It is also readily available to Americans – already approved as a malaria and anti-inflammation treatment by the FDA – where it is an off-the-shelf drug with various low-cost generic versions. Despite the emergency use order, the FDA has not conducted clinical trials to fully ascertain whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19.Trump was influenced by a widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.However, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, with Olivier Véran, France’s health minister, saying that it shouldn’t be used by anyone with the exception of “serious forms of hospitalization and on the collegial decision of doctors and under strict medical supervision”.The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections from Sars-CoV-2, the virus behind Covid-19, by blocking it from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn’t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhea.Regardless of these findings, any drug being used for a certain purpose before full clinical trials are completed is, by definition, untested and unproven. It’s too early to say if hydroxychloroquine can have a major benefit or not.The European Medicines Agency, an agency of the EU, has said hydroxychloroquine should not be taken by coronavirus patients except for clinical trials or emergency use programs.Like many drugs, hydroxychloroquine comes with a number of potential side-effects. These include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, weight loss and mood changes.Worse, a sudden surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. Hydroxychloroquine is able to keep lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease, in check but some people with the condition have complained they are now unable to find Plaquenil. Trump’s pushing of the treatment has caused many Americans, whether they need it or not, to stock up on the drug.The latest Chinese research suggests that using hydroxychloroquine is no better than more conventional coronavirus treatments, such as bed rest, antiviral drugs and oxygen inhalation. There are about 40 different research efforts around the world to find a vaccine, which may take a year or more, while scientists rummaging around in the existing medical cabinet have identified some other drugs that may be repurposed to tackle Covid-19. But this work, too, will take time.There is no magic cure for this pandemic, no matter what Trump says.Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

A seven-year-old Greek prodigy has penned an “isolation waltz” inspired by the pandemic. The hypnotic, fugue-like melody has picked up more than 43,000 hits on YouTube since its launch last week.“Hi guys! I’m Stelios. Let’s be just a teeny bit more patient and we will soon be out swimming in the sea,” he beams, perched on his piano stool, feet barely touching the floor. “I’m dedicating to you a piece of my own.”The work, his third composition, was written especially “for people who suffer and those who isolate because of Covid-19,” he adds.Born in Athens in 2012 to Fotis and Agathe Kerasidis, both pianists who now teach him, Stelios first performed in public at the age of three. In 2018 he played Chopin’s Waltz in A Minor at New York’s Carnegie Hall, and last year he appeared at London’s Royal Albert Hall performing on Elton John’s famous red piano.Stelios says his favourite pianist is the late Canadian Glenn Gould, best known for his technically demanding renditions of Bach variations.The Greek has shown a flare for composing. His two earlier works were written for his sisters, Veronica and Anastasia, and like Isolation Waltz were met with critical acclaim.Greece has been under lockdown for longer than most other European nations, the government having closed schools almost a month ago. Last week the government announced that swimming was also forbidden as the measures were ramped up.The precautionary steps appear to be working: Greece has reported 79 deaths and fewer than 1,800 confirmed coronavirus cases, far fewer than some other countries. Stelios, who is likely to be homebound for some time yet, has not hinted whether he has another composition up his sleeve. "

Alperton bus garage driver Said Musse and Holloway driver Emeka Nyack Ihenacho lost their lives along with Paul Aheto, who worked as a supervisor at the Willesden garage.A Metroline spokesman said: “It is with immense sadness that we can confirm that three of our colleagues have passed away after contracting coronavirus.“We are devastated by this loss and we offer our support and condolences to the families at this incredibly difficult time.“The safety of our employees has always been our priority and we continue to do everything we can to make sure our workforce is as protected and as safe as possible during this unprecedented time.”Nadir Nur was one of the eight bus drivers in London to die in the last few days. The 48-year-old was described as a quiet but well liked individual at his depot. He worked for HCT Group and drove the 394 bus between Islington and Hackney, and was described to be in good health before being infected.Tributes were also paid to Rodolfo Silva who had worked for bus company Go-Ahead London. A spokesman for the company said: “We were informed on Friday morning that Mr Silva had sadly died. The cause of his death has yet to be established.“Our thoughts are with Mr Silva’s family and friends at this very difficult time. Mr Silva was a dedicated and popular member of our Waterside Way team.”The ninth bus worker was Martin Egan, who had worked as a driver in Bristol for 40 years. He died on Saturday after falling ill two weeks ago.The Unite union’s regional secretary for the south-west Steve Preddy paid tribute to Egan, describing him as a “dedicated and long-serving member of the Unite Bristol bus family”.As the news of the deaths sunk in on Monday, some drivers remained seriously concerned about their own wellbeing. One bus driver on a west London route has taken to bringing clingfilm from his own kitchen to cover perforations in Perspex screens shielding him from coronavirus infection inside his cabin.In a letter to the Guardian on Monday, the partner of the bus worker also revealed that he takes a urine bottle with him on his journeys because unofficial toilet stops for drivers are now closed.Eileen Hill (not her real name) said her partner, who also wishes to remain anonymous but whose status has been verified by the Guardian, even brings his own sanitiser and mask to protect himself from contracting Covid-19.“He takes safety into his own hands,” she said. “He brings his own clingfilm, mask, hand sanitiser and a huge spray bottle of Dettol. He disinfects the cab before he gets in, sprays his mask, arranges his clingfilm and opens the window as wide as it will go. With mixed reports around whether this disease is airborne, he just hopes these measures are enough,” his wife said.She continued: “The working conditions have worsened since the new rules (on self-isolation and lockdown). Now everywhere is shut, the toilets have gone too, and he has to carry his own urine bottle – a situation that’s far worse for female drivers.”Hill’s partner had an informal arrangement like other drivers with a local swimming pool, a snooker hall and a café on his route to go to the toilet during the journey, she said.The bus driver’s partner said he has told her that while most people are obeying the lockdown and social-distancing rules some are not.In her letter Hill relates an incident at the weekend on his bus: “‘You’re late,’ spits a stocky man in baseball cap, as he taps his Oyster card, tiny flecks of phlegm hitting the clingfilm my husband has used to cover the holes in the Perspex around the cab. He taps the pre-recorded message. ‘It’s all a hoax,’ yells the man leaning closer.“That is why my partner takes safety into his own hands. “The TfL spokesperson stressed that it was in discussion with unions over the issues they have raised about safety and protective measures.“We all want to ensure the greatest level of safety for everyone in the bus industry and for the critical workers who need to make absolutely essential bus journeys,” she said.Unite’s representative for London bus workers John Murphy said it was “hardly surprising” that one of his colleagues was deploying his own means of protection against the virus on his vehicle.Murphy said the union has been informed by TFL that by the middle of this week Perspex screens with full cover will be in place on all buses in use across the capital.“I am not in the least surprised that the driver has taken these steps by himself. These protective measures should be made available to him but in their absence it is understandable and I am sure others are doing this too,” he said."

The death of a West Dumbartonshire care worker that emerged on Sunday was also confirmed by the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon.The fatalities came amid rising concern that those working in social care still do not have the protection they need amid the Covid-19 pandemic and that, without testing for the virus, staff risk contaminating care homes where elderly people are supposed to be “shielded”.Peter Kyle, the MP for Hove – which has about 30 care homes - said facilities were effectively being “converted into hospices” because of a lack of protections. He said one home in his constituency had recorded 14 cases of coronavirus in residents aged over 75.In Scotland, at least 15 residents at the 90-capacity Burlington Court care home in Glasgow have died after displaying symptoms of the virus.They all had underlying health conditions and several were on “end of life pathways”, according to the care provider, Four Seasons. It declined to provide an update on further deaths, amid unconfirmed reports that several more residents were infected.Nadra Ahmed, the executive chair of the National Care Association, which represents small and medium-sized care providers, said: “The issue we hear most is: ‘I am desperate for masks. Has anyone got any gloves? I am down to my last stock.’“Once you run out, it is a question of being down to Marigolds and bin liners. Government has not reacted quickly enough to build confidence in the sector that PPE [personal protective equipment] is available.”Kent county council is so short of protection items that it has asked partner organisations and thousands of its staff to try to drum up supplies. It said on Monday it has made “strong representations” to the government about shortages and has been promised deliveries, but believes these will not meet its needs.On 25 March, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was asked in parliament when all care home workers would get the protective equipment they needed and replied: “By the end of the week.”Many in the care sector say this has not happened.Liz Kendall, Labour MP for Leicester West, said about one in three care homes in her constituency still had no PPE on Friday.“While [chancellor] Rishi Sunak was right to say the NHS would get whatever resources it needs, the same has got to be true for social care because the two services are inextricably linked,” she said.Care workers can use large quantities of PPE if they follow government guidance that – in care homes with suspected or confirmed Covid cases or on domestic visits to a shielded person – they should wear gloves, plastic apron, mask and possibly eye and face protection.Some care managers are going into debt to keep staff and residents safe. Anita Astle, the manager of the Wren Hall nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where nine residents are in isolation with suspected Covid-19, paid £9,000 for a consignment of masks at £2.74 each – five times the usual price – because government supplies were insufficient.“The first delivery [from the government supply] was 160 masks,” she said. “I told them we were using 312 a day. I waited four days and got 400. The supply chain is completely useless.”Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA, said: “People who work in the care sector are extraordinary individuals, each and every one of them, and I can’t impress enough how important it is that we get testing and adequate levels of PPE to keep them and residents safe.”The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment."

Because there are widespread shortages of medical-grade face masks, and leaders and experts agree those should be reserved for healthcare providers, individuals are largely making face masks at home.Jeremy Howard, a University of San Francisco researcher and the co-founder of Masks 4 All, explains how to create your own, with no sewing required.Start with an old T-shirt, preferably 100% cotton – anything will do, as long as it’s not too thin – and outline the pattern of the mask. The bottom line should go just beneath the armpits of the shirt. Make sure the part that goes on your face is large enough to cover your nose and mouth.Cut along the lines through both sides of the shirt so that your mask has two layers.Place a safety pin along the bottom and insert a piece of paper towel or coffee filter in between the two layers of the T-shirt. This acts as an additional filter, and rests on top of the safety pin.Secure the mask around the front of your face, covering your nose and mouth. Tie the top straps under the back of your head and the bottom straps at the top of your head. That will ensure a nice fit underneath your chin. By covering your mouth, you have now protected those around you, and the better the fit, the more you’re going to also protect yourself.Start with a handkerchief and two hair ties. Rubber bands are okay as well, although they will be less comfortable.Follow the handkerchief in half, along a horizontal axis, and make a nice crease.Place piece of paper towel or coffee filter at the center of the handkerchief. Fold the top down and the bottom up, so that the coffee filter or paper towel rests in the fold.Place your first elastic about one-third of the way in from the edge of the handkerchief. Place the second elastic one-third of the way in from the other side. The two elastics should be about one hand-width apart.Fold the left side in toward the center and then fold the right side in toward the center, tucking the right side into the left-side flap.Don’t wear it at home, and don’t wear it in the car, unless you’re with people outside your regular family group. Don’t wear it more than necessary – just wear it when you’re in a public place, like a supermarket, where you might be within 6ft of people. It may not be necessary in a park or on a quiet street with few pedestrians, when you’re moving around.Don’t remove the mask until you’re at home or in a place where you can wash your hands and avoid coming within 6ft of other people. When you do remove the mask, avoid touching the front of it in case you breathed in infected droplets that could now be there.Remove and dispose of the paper towel insert. Place the rest of the mask in soapy water, soak it for two minutes, then wash and rinse. Any kind of soap – dish soap, laundry detergent, hand soap – will do. Then wash your hands, and disinfect with bleach or alcohol anything you touched after taking off the mask. Never reuse a mask without washing it first.Next time you wear the mask, remember to replace the paper-towel insert.If you have symptoms – a stuffy nose, a cough, a fever – stay inside."

Germany’s Dax closed up nearly 6%.However, New York-based foreign exchange company OANDA warned that optimism among stock investors could fizzle out, once attention returns to the likelihood of lasting consumer caution.“The rally in equities will likely be short-lived as investors will soon have to become sceptical of the great recovery and focus on the financial stress that will happen after several key parts of the economy will not come back to life for many months,” said senior market analyst Edward Moya.“Travel, entertainment, and physical retail (excluding food and drug) will not see any normalcy until much later in the year. I don’t see people going to a Broadway show, baseball game or trying to book a vacation this summer.”In the UK, the FTSE’s gain was all the more remarkable given dismal figures from the construction and automotive sectors, which have been ravaged by shutdowns caused by Covid-19.Construction suffered the sharpest fall in activity since the financial crisis during March, a survey showed on Monday, despite the industry being slower than other industries to shut down operations due to the coronavirus.The figures from financial data provider IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) also confirmed data last week that showed the British private sector as a whole is contracting at its fastest rate in more than 20 years.The construction Purchasing Managers’ Index tumbled to 39.3 in March from 52.6 in February, with anything below 50 representing a decline in activity. The drop took the index to its lowest level since April 2009 and well below economists’ average forecast of 44.0.The 13-point monthly fall was the largest since the survey began in 1997, and the index could worsen still.“The sector is stuck in quicksand and sinking further,” Duncan Brock, group director at Cips, said.Some construction projects have continued, with workers spaced two metres apart, allowing construction to escape the complete shutdowns seen elsewhere, such as in the hospitality industry.Gareth Belsham, director of property consultancy Naismiths, said the continuation of some activity, coupled with the sector’s experience of recovering from economic turmoil, should give cause for optimism.“Few sectors have more bitter, regular experience of enduring sharp falls in confidence than construction.“Battle scars in of themselves will provide no protection from a simultaneous drop in both demand and supply. But the fact that the declines seen during the 2008 financial crisis were worse offers some comfort. Construction weathered that storm successfully, and will do so again.”The automotive sector has been particularly hard hit over the past three weeks. Every major car manufacturer in the UK has shut down its factories and the industry trade body revealed on Monday that demand for new vehicles has also plunged, spelling more trouble ahead for the sector.Sales of new cars in March fell 44% compared with the same month last year to 254,684 units, while first-quarter sales were down by 31% to 483,557, the SMMT said.The trade body also slashed its sales forecast for this year by 23% to 1.73m vehicles because of the impact of the coronavirus crisis."

As a child I would most certainly have been hiding behind the sofa. And if a Cyberman came marching down the road, that would be it, I’d be running for my life!”Tayside police in Scotland shared the video, saying: “Our colleagues in Skaro division have deployed their Direct Action Local Enforcement Kops to ensure everyone is following guidelines about isolation and social distancing.”An eight-year-old girl from Chesterfield has thanked NHS staff and key workers with an elaborate window display featuring hundreds of their names.Grace Cooper came up with the idea as a way of keeping busy during the lockdown, and, after her mum issued a callout for names on Facebook, they were soon inundated.She has carefully written each name on a love heart, around a sign that reads: “Not all heroes wear capes.”Grace said: “It’s to thank all the key workers for going out and risking their lives to save us. I want them all to know they are appreciated and we are grateful to them.”Her mother, Lauren Liggatt, told the Derbyshire Times: “We’ve got hundreds of names now and I’ve got a huge pile which I need to put up. We’ve filled one window are now moving on to another one.“Grace is really pleased with it and I am so proud of her. She said she wanted to thank the people who are working to keep us safe and well, and that is so nice of her.”A four-year-old boy whose birthday celebrations were cancelled because of the coronavirus lockdown was treated to a visit from a local police officer who stopped by to lift his spirits on the big day.Dexter Lee should have been celebrating his birthday on holiday with his family but the trip had to be cancelled when the lockdown came into force.Unable to see any of his friends or family on the special day, Dexter’s mum, Anna, asked if anyone knew of a police officer who could cheer up her son, who wants to join the force when he is older, with a special wave as they drove past.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

We are so overwhelmed by the effort the police went to today. It has brought a lot of cheer to us and the whole neighbourhood,” Dexter’s parents said.Hundreds of travellers are still stranded around the world after coronavirus lockdowns came into force – but one honeymooning couple ended up better off than most.Surrounded by a fleet of staff catering to their every need on a luxury Maldivian resort, Olivia and Raul De Freitas have found themselves on an eternal honeymoon.Arriving at the Cinnamon Velifushi Maldives resort on 22 March for what was supposed to be a six-night stay, the newlyweds were soon the only two guests left when their home country, South Africa, closed its airports in response to the pandemic and they were unable to leave.The resort, which hosts up to 180 guests, continued to put on a full performance in the dining hall each night for the pair while nine staff members remained on standby.Room service checked on them five times a day, while other workers treated the couple to an elaborate candlelit dinner on the beach, they told the New York Times.They were told they would have to hire a chartered jet with other South Africans stuck in the Maldives in order to get home. But, at a cost of a $104,000, they decided to stay put.They have now been transferred to another luxury resort, along with other South Africans in the region, with a large proportion of their costs subsidised. However, their return date remains unknown."

Something that we have thus far not introduced.”Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start. Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the NHS 111 coronavirus service to find out what to do.Source: NHS England on 23 March 2020There is a danger that people will arrive in hospital only when their symptoms are very severe, with more of a risk that they will end up in critical care and possibly die, he said.The early symptoms of mild disease are a persistent dry cough, a raised temperature and shortness of breath. The advice to anyone with those symptoms is to self-isolate at home. They are not told to inform the health service.Most people recover within a week, but if their symptoms worsen or they still have a high temperature at the end of that time, the instruction is to fill in a form on the NHS 111 coronavirus website if they can – and to call NHS 111 only if they cannot do that. Depending on their answers, they may get a visit from a doctor or be admitted to hospital.Covid-19 is said to be mild to moderate in 80% of people, but can cause viral pneumonia. In the most serious cases, the immune system fighting the virus overreacts. If that happens, what is known as a cytokine storm attacks their organs. The individual will need ventilation in hospital to take over their breathing and possibly mechanical support for their heart, liver or kidneys.People with symptoms at home will not get medical help unless they ask for it, unlike in some other countries, which have testing for people with symptoms and monitoring for them while at home.Health authorities in the southern German city of Heidelberg have introduced a “corona taxi” service, which allows medical personnel to visit patients with the virus at home and assess their progress. This was introduced after virologists and other doctors recognised that it often comes in two waves and that typically on the eighth day, patients’ health can take a turn for the worse.Patients with confirmed infections or suspected to have coronavirus are being called on a regular basis by student doctors manning phone lines, and based on their accounts, a taxi crew can then arrange to visit them.Four of the taxis – small buses usually used for school runs – are constantly travelling around the city visiting patients. “These daily phone calls and house visits would totally overwhelm the doctors here,” said Uta Merle, a medical director for gastroenterology and infections at Heidelberg University hospital, which is why medical students are being drafted in. Eight hundred have so far volunteered.Hans-Georg Kräusslich, the head of virology at the hospital, told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung the visits are necessary because “often patients don’t have the courage to ring up the clinic and don’t actually take their worsening state seriously”.Thanks to the taxis, he said, “our colleagues have discovered quite a few patients who they were able to protect from a drastic worsening of their conditions”. Many have been brought into hospital and put on ventilators as a result. That crucial move made just in time is believed to have saved many lives in Germany. The taxi crews have received letters of thanks from patients, crediting them with saving their lives.Pankhania said people in the UK are no longer going to hospital for conditions other than Covid-19 in the sort of numbers that would be expected. “For whatever reason, we have frightened off the patient. Those things we should be seeing are not turning up. These people are soldiering on,” he said.He has himself heard of cases where people were very sick with symptoms resembling those of Covid-19, but did not seek medical help and died at home.He said it was possible that some people were put off from calling NHS 111 when their symptoms worsened or if they still had a fever after a week – which are the first clues that their condition may be becoming severe.He also does not think it is satisfactory for people with symptoms not to be tested. “I don’t think that is good enough,” he said. “I used to be a GP. I would want to know who my patients with Covid-19 were. I would call them and ask them how they were. Unfortunately, that doesn’t happen. The GP may or may not be aware of the patient.”The Office for National Statistics has recently begun to include deaths from Covid-19 in the community, including care homes. They show the total was more than 20% higher than the figure for hospital deaths alone."

At the very least, we all decided that we had to respect principles of diplomacy.”Meanwhile, Iran announced plans to ban printed newspapers in an effort to slow the spread of the disease. Editors of seven titles including the reformist Etemad and Ebtekar protested against the decision, saying it represented a further incursion of press freedom and would bankrupt them.Alireza Zali, the commander-in-chief of the anti-coronavirus HQ in Tehran, said: “Especially in Tehran province, we have witnessed a very serious change in the presence and movement of people in cities, and unfortunately, at a time when we are witnessing this increase in motor traffic, the numbers entering Tehran’s hospitals is still increasing.”He said there had been a 25% increase in hospital admissions and a 15% increase in intensive care admissions on Sunday compared with the previous day.Iran said on Monday that its death toll from coronavirus had risen to 3,739, an increase of 136 in the past 24 hours, and a total of 60,500 people had been infected, up 2,274 since the previous day."

Some 85% of voters aged 18 to 34 years were very or quite concerned.However, the federal government will take heart from the broad support, and the Essential poll revealed a significant number of Morrison’s traditional political enemies were among those saluting him.It found 45% of Labor voters approved or strongly approved of his performance.

That produced a net approval rating of 46% of Labor loyalists.And a remarkable 29% of Green voters backed or strongly backed the prime minister.

Then they came for pasta, rice and tinned food. A week or so later, there was a shortage of napkins, paper towels and tissues.On 22 March there was a run on bottle shops, as shoppers, thinking outlets might close under new laws, stockpiled alcohol. In the confusion as to whether bottle shops were an essential service, trolleys were stacked with spirits, wine and cases of beer.“Can report there is now panic buying at Dan Murphy’s. Every car space in our local branch is full, everyone is loading up. We’re going to be one trashed socially isolated nation for a while,” one person wrote on Twitter.Can report there is now panic buying at Dan Murphy's. Every car space in our local branch is full, every one is loading up. We're going to be one trashed socially isolated nation for a while.Commsec reported spending was up more than 20% in the week ending 20 March, compared with the same time last year; and in the week to March 27, spending at liquor stores in Australia was up 86%. Although that rise was off-set by the closure of bars, restaurants and pubs, that week Australians still spent 34% more on alcohol than at the same period the previous year.Now we’re all sitting at home drinking our stockpiled alcohol and having parties on apps, but experts are warning that as well as the pandemic, we’re facing another public health crisis – heavy drinking.Peter, a 59-year-old marketing manager from Sydney’s upper north shore, was one of those stockpiling alcohol on the weekend of 22 March.His wife brought three cases of champagne, while he bought “two lots of wine – three crates [12 bottles] both times – and it’s time to refresh those”.“Since I’ve been working from home, I’ve been slipping into bad ways. I’m not concerned about it yet – but it’s not a good habit,” says Peter, who has been in lockdown for two weeks.Before quarantine, he only drank on weekends, but now he says, “We’re both [Peter and his wife] working from home and we’ve been drinking every day starting at 5.30pm. Right now, there’s no consequences – no one notices if you get a bit wooly the next day, and other people are in the same boat. There’s a lot of drinking memes going round. I am not at all surprised that … sales are going through the roof,” he says.Professor Michael Farrell, director of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales Sydney, says the scenes broadcast from crowded bottle shops in late March showed “there’s been an assault on bottle shops – and it’s very clear that sales have gone up. The vulnerability is for people who are already on the margins of heavy drinking. They have had their constraints removed from them.”These constraints, removed by staying at home, include being able to drink during the day, or being hungover without being detected by employers.It creates a situation where people are habituated to drinking dailyBut he says people are also drinking because of “the anxiety about the complex social situation we are in. People are worried about their jobs, finances and getting ill. They are stockpiling alcohol – it’s a social storm”. Chris Raine, founder of Hello Sunday Morning, a movement that aims to help people reduce or quit drinking via an accountability app and online counselling, has noticed an “uptick” in the service since people started self-isolating. “Registrations have doubled,” he says.“It’s really quite scary to be honest – it’s a perfect storm because you have a culture that does rely on alcohol to de-stress and deal with anxiety and now those stresses and anxieties have gone through the roof as a result of the virus.”Raine worries that under these conditions, “it creates a situation where people are habituated to drinking daily”.This unusual situation creates the possibility of a cascade effect, says Raine. Weekend drinkers become weekday drinkers; social drinkers become daily drinkers; and those struggling with sobriety, who have relied on the face-to-face assistance of groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (now using Zoom because of physical distancing rules), will relapse.Farrell agrees, saying people “are left socially isolated – so the normal help is gone”.He hopes apps such as Daybreak (set up by Raine’s Hello Sunday Morning team) will bridge the gap created by the suspension of face-to-face support groups and counselling.“One of the things you can do is promote telephone services for counselling people – it’s not very hard to switch into that,” he says. “And you can use apps to get support while isolating. Prevention programs will come later down the line.”Farrell says right now “the only thing you could do [to halt the problem] potentially is to ration sales”.Currently the industry’s self-imposed ration limit is fairly generous, says Farrell.On 1 April, large alcohol retailers in most states (except Western Australia where there are already measures in force) signed up for a voluntary code that limits the amount of liquor customers can buy in one transaction.Beer, cider and premixed spirits are limited to two cases, and wine to 12 bottles per customer, while cask wine and bottled spirits are limited to two items each.People should have a number of days where they forgo alcoholAny further restrictions, such as closing bottle shops, might be too much to bear, says Farrell, as “there is enough social control at the moment”.Instead, “we should focus people on learning physical and mental health hygiene and good regimes around exercise and food. People should have a number of days where they forgo alcohol”.When Raine saw “the rush on buying alcohol”, he says, “My gut reaction was ‘typical’ and ‘understandable’ but then digging into it, it’s how Australians see alcohol as an essential service – almost culturally seeing alcohol as an essential medicine.”Raine acknowledges that if the bottle shops were not deemed an essential service and shut down, the results would be disastrous. “You’d have tens of thousands of people going into involuntary detox and not having the health system able to cope. I wish people didn’t culturally depend on alcohol the way they do.”For people like Peter, entering his third week in social isolation, this is the week to start tracking his drinking.“There’s moments where it’s appropriate to say ‘bugger it’ and get drunk, but you can’t maintain that throughout the crisis.”Friday night was going to be Peter’s first Zoom drinks with friends, but the following week he decided to go back to drinking only two nights a week, on weekends.“It’s very novel territory – it’s hard,” says Raine. “But all difficult things bear the fruit of opportunity. And we can grow and become more resilient.”"

That failure was both one of the delayed response and the “longer-term strategic issue” of Australia’s sovereign capabilities at times of crisis.“With all the conversations on testing, why did it take until this month to seek information about Covid-19 test kit materials?” he said.Australia has conducted 299,000 tests and has one of the highest testing rates per capita in the world. Jurisdictions such as Victoria have recently moved to relax testing criteria, a move likely to boost testing rates further still.But the unprecedented demand has put pressure on stocks of consumable material used in the conventional laboratory testing process.In mid-March, the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy warned of temporary shortages, which he said were impacting “the scale of testing that we can do at the moment”.About the same time, Murphy wrote to general practitioners warning them “the situation regarding pathology test kits, reagents and swabs is deteriorating rapidly, with kits no longer being available in some regions of the country”.The government has also privately asked universities to search their campuses for any material that might be able to be used in testing, sought extra supply from abroad, and worked to ensure the supply chains of testing companies were secure.Industry minister Karen Andrews said the government had been working “for some time” on developing domestic manufacturing options for Covid-19 testing materials. Friday’s callout to industry was simply an extension of that work, she said.“Securing Australia’s testing capacity for Covid-19 is one of the Australian government’s highest priorities,” Andrews said. “We have secured vast amounts of testing kits from major international suppliers that is meeting current demand, while simultaneously working to ensure we build our domestic capability.”“We have been working with Australian companies for some time to ensure supply and to look to develop domestic manufacturing options.”No one has yet responded to the government’s callout – known as a request for information – in the short time since it was issued. But similar moves – including one to gauge interest in manufacturing PPE – have drawn a significant response.The government has also approved a different type of test – an antibody test – which can rapidly return a result without the need for laboratory testing.It has announced $2.6m for diagnostics research at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity to give a greater ability for widespread testing for diagnosis and clearance.“Australia has one of the highest testing rates in the world and combined with our strict social distancing measures is helping to slow the spread of coronavirus,” Andrews said."

 Morrison has changed tack against his tribal instincts. But what happens after coronavirus? ","After jettisoning key policies, embracing economic stimulus and taking a more decisive position on lockdowns and wages, the prime minister has enjoyed a resounding surge in personal support.This turnaround echoes that of George Costanza, Jerry Seinfeld’s hapless sidekick, who hit a winning streak after committing to do the exact opposite of his every natural instinct.So too Scott Morrison: the states forced him to be more decisive on lockdowns, especially schools, while unions and businesses prevailed on him to reverse his earlier opposition to wage subsidy. This followed his new conversion to Keynesian economics, most recently injecting billions into free childcare, a notion ridiculed by his team as communism before the last election.Full credit to Morrison and his government for changing tack and bringing more stakeholders to the decision-making table, but again this is something that would chafe with the PM’s natural, more tribal instincts.The “big tent” leadership approach is that which the Rudd government brought to the GFC and Bill Shorten would have been expected to adopt if he had been successful at last year’s election when he ran on a “team” ticket. In contrast, Morrison’s shtick was one man and a baseball cap.But these are unprecedented times, and as this week’s Essential Report shows, the public is ready to embrace someone who approaches leadership as a team game.Like Costanza, the PM changed up from a position of relative weakness. The first weeks of the crisis had not been strong for the PM – the rating of 39% approval reflected the mixed messages, especially the Trumpian “I’m going to the footy” with a reluctance to step up distancing measures.Thirty-nine per cent Morrison needed to play the team game. The question will be whether 59% Morrison recognises this cooperation is the foundation of his new authority or whether he reverts to typical Costanza-like behaviour.The increase in approval for government comes in a week where the public appeared to (finally) twig to the reality of the crisis, with fewer people seeing the response as an underreaction. Through the crisis the trends of trust in both government and media continue to rise, while the personal financial concerns have abated somewhat since the announcement of the jobkeeper allowance.For opposition leader Anthony Albanese, this is a difficult period for different reasons. Having been left out of the national cabinet, Albanese is forced to lead from the sidelines.This is reflected in the relatively flat response to the opposition leader’s performance. No drop-off with the increased satisfaction in the PM, but no statistical relevant increase in his standing either.There are important roles for the opposition in the here and now, scrutinising government decisions without being seen to block; Labor’s role, for example, in the wage subsidy turnaround should not be underestimated.But the political contest will be reloaded during the economic reconstruction. That’s where we will learn whether the responses to a crisis of working together to co-create solutions can prevail.What will be the rules governing any “snap back”? How will the rights of workers and citizens be reinstituted after the crisis? As Greg Jericho argued over the weekend, talk of socialism is overblown, the government’s response still runs the risk of preserving interests of businesses over the interests of workers, and when “hibernation” ends there will be genuine contests over which will carry.Will the tax system, for instance, continue to skew in favour of those with existing capital? Will the government persevere with its plans for a regressive flat tax? Who will bear the costs of bringing the budget back into balance?Will a party that has never believed in government have the wherewithal to think through ideas like joint equity and mutual ownership, or will they just revert to type and find the only solution in a corporate framework?How will the government support new and newly relevant industries, as the reality of a globally constrained world demands new local capabilities and supply chains?These broader questions, rather than the management of the crisis, will frame the choices voters make in 2022, a date that right now feels an eternity away.The challenge in opposition right now is to think through and start the process of defining those choices.Morrison will rightly gain plaudits for managing Australia’s response, providing he continues to temper his natural instincts to go one out and divide. But even Winston Churchill could not translate that leadership into re-election after the second world war ended.George H Bush made it to 89% after the first Gulf war, only to lose the presidency to Bill Clinton two years later. Even his son hit mid-80s after 9/11.The reality for both leaders is that support in a time of national crisis is ephemeral, politics unites for a time but there will be time for a renewed contest in the months to come.• Peter Lewis will be discussing this week’s report with Katharine Murphy at 1pm on Tuesday 7 April at Australia at Home’s Political Geekfest."

But Heap says it only has one to two weeks of PPE left.“We’ve struggled for quite a while,” Heap told the Guardian. “We’ve run out. We found a few gowns that we could use, but we haven’t got a good supply at all.”“We know we’re not the only ones asking for PPE, it’s across the nation. But we’re trying to provide a service to the Aboriginal community across Victoria and we’d like to be able to help with testing.“It just makes it easier for our community to come to our health services to get tested … they know us.”Aboriginal health services in both NSW and Victoria have been shifting to telehealth wherever possible to reduce demand on PPE and employing social distancing measures to protect staff and patients.“We’re actually in Ballarat just starting to make our own gowns as well, just in readiness, just in case we need them,” Heap said. “We’re hoping we don’t need them, but if we do, we’ve got some people in our community who can sew, so we’ve put them to task,”But Heap said if more equipment was not received soon, the consequences would be serious.“We just won’t be able to test at all and we’ll have to be very careful about who we see through the clinic, especially people with the symptoms of the virus,” she said.The release of PPE from the federal government’s national medical stockpile – a reserve of medical equipment held in secret locations across the country – is being prioritised to those who need it most.The government has identified Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as a high-risk group during the Covid-19 pandemic, because of overall higher rates of respiratory disease, heart disease, and diabetes, as well as overcrowded housing.A taskforce of experts in Indigenous health and epidemiology advising the national cabinet has released a detailed plan for dealing with the virus, which recommends urgent supplies of PPE and other medical equipment to regional and remote areas.But, in a further sign of the severity of PPE shortages among Aboriginal medical services, NSW health minister Brad Hazzard and Aboriginal affairs minister Don Harwin wrote to federal health minister Greg Hunt asking for help last week.It is understood the pair asked the federal government to urgently increase the supply of PPE to Aboriginal community-controlled health services in NSW.They also asked that changes be made to allow Aboriginal medical services direct access to the national medical stockpile – an emergency reserve of medical equipment – rather than having to make their requests through the primary health network.Such allowances have already been made for the aged care sector.A NSW Health spokeswoman said the state and federal governments were working together to “urgently increase the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services”.The state government has also provided a “one-off supply” of PPE to the sector in the week beginning 23 March, the spokeswoman said.Hunt on Sunday announced that about 11m masks had recently been distributed to frontline workers, and that the national medical stockpile had been replenished by the receipt of 30m masks in recent weeks.A spokeswoman said 1.6m surgical and P2 masks had been distributed to the NSW government in recent days.“Significant additional supplies of masks have now arrived in Australia and the government is working with states and territories to allocate an initial additional 10 million masks to support front line healthcare professionals,” she said.“There are global shortages of masks and other PPE and the government is securing supplies to meet the demand of states and territories.”Hunt expects to make up to 200m masks available by the end of the year and finance minister, Mathias Cormann, announced an additional $800m for PPE supply on the weekend.The government has attempted to help local manufacturers to pivot into PPE production and help existing producer Med-Con to boost its output.The Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW last week warned that clinics require urgent action to boost PPE stocks."

It can take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear in infected individuals.The coronavirus, which has infected nearly 350,000 worldwide and killed more than 9,600 people in the US so far, continues to wreak havoc on workers in industries deemed essential, including supermarkets and factories.As the virus first made headway in the US, several workers at other Walmart locations told the Guardian they were concerned about working in crowded environments and whether the firm was putting concern for profits over safety.“I’m 64 years old and according to the CDC, I should be staying home and practicing social distancing and in quarantine,” said a customer service manager, also in the midwest. “I can’t do that as I can’t afford to take off work unpaid.”The worker opted to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.Other workers shared reports of increased workloads, short staffing and a lack of sanitation protections or hazard compensation.A Walmart spokesperson at the time referred to corporate press releases and an updated sick leave policy. Under it, workers are permitted to take unpaid time off if they don’t feel well.Those diagnosed with coronavirus or quarantined can receive two weeks of paid sick leave.The company announced 20 March it would hire 150,000 workers nationwide to meet demand. Full-time employees will receive about $300 each in bonuses.Dan Bartlett, Walmart-vice president of corporate affairs, told reporters the company waited to secure protective gear to avoid further limiting equipment that could go to strained healthcare workers across the country.He added the US’s largest grocer and private employer will need more than 7m masks each week for its employees. The first shipment will arrive in two weeks.Last Friday, Walmart announced community protection measures including a reduced number of permitted customers in store, employee temperature checks and limited store hours to allow for cleaning and restocking.Bartlett noted the company’s new measures were based on employee feedback, insisting leaders “try very hard to keep [their] finger on the pulse of [the] workforce”."

Johnson has lost weight since then, but it has fluctuated significantly throughout his political career.Sonia Purnell, author of Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition, said that the prime minister’s usual wellbeing was striking. “By and large, he is remarkably fit considering he is actually a bit overweight,” she said. “He’s not really that active, his runs aren’t very long or very energetic and he is very fond of cheese. In fact, he likes eating a lot – nothing wrong with that – but he does have a very robust constitution. In the time I’ve known him since the 90s, illness has never really come up.”Johnson became a devoted runner in the early 2000s. In his book Boris: The Rise of Boris Johnson, Andrew Gimson notes the prime minister also took up cycling in London in 1999 and quickly became “the most famous cyclist in Britain”. Gimson added that cycling had several attractions for Boris: “It was energetic, dangerous, anarchic.” While he was mayor of London, Johnson was involved in several near-miss accidents while cycling, including a 2009 incident in east London.In 2013, Johnson went on a major health kick before taking part in the first Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100, a now annual closed-roads cycle ride out of the capital and into the countryside. At the start of his training regime, which he styled Operation Chiselled Whippet, Johnson, who was then 48, conceded that he was “pushing 17 stone, and since my normal cycling speed is so slow that my wife says it is a miracle I stay upright, I have decided to get in shape”.When Theresa May made him foreign secretary in 2016, Johnson lamented the impact the job had on his lifestyle. While he was back on his bike after returning to the backbench, his cycling days were limited, as he would soon be entering No 10.As well as jogging and cycling, Johnsonis a keen tennis player. At an auction for the Conservative party’s annual winter ball, a game of tennis with the prime minister was auctioned for £45,000.Purnell traces Johnson’s appetite for sport to his childhood, when he was encouraged to run, jump, and play “whiff-whaff”, better known as table tennis. At Eton, he played rugby and cricket, and took part in the Wall Game, a sport unique to the private school.More recently, Johnson is reported to have given up his running due to issues with his knees. The prime minister instead participates in online classes that include yoga and pilates.Purnell says the hospital admission will be difficult for Johnson who, like his father, rarely admits to illness or notices it in others. “When I worked with him as his deputy [in the Daily Telegraph’s Brussels bureau], he was certainly very, very intolerant of illness in others, and considered it as sort of a weakness.”Additional reporting by Peter Walker"

But because they are so sensitive they pick up other sources too, including human activity, so road traffic, people walking past and nearby factories,” said Brian Baptie, a seismologist at BGS in Edinburgh. “All these things generate vibrations and those propagate through the Earth.”Human-induced vibrations, known in the trade as “cultural noise”, spread through the planet differently to tremors from earthquakes and tend to die away a few miles from their origins. But seismometers placed near urban centres still pick up plenty of noise that makes it harder for scientists to analyse the more valuable seismic data.The UK’s network of sensitive instruments picked up markedly fewer vibrations last week as the coronavirus lockdown took hold, the researchers found. “We had a look at the data from some of our seismic stations around the UK and we do see an effect,” said Baptie. At some sensors, cultural noise is running at five decibels lower than normal, about a quarter down on usual readings. Similar falls have been spotted by Belgian seismologists based in Brussels.The BGS operates a national network of about 80 seismometers from Shetland to Jersey that provide a constant ear to the ground. The data are pored over by BGS scientists and fed into a global network that is used to monitor earthquakes anywhere on the planet. In contrast to low-frequency tremors, cultural noise vibrations are high-frequency waves, around one to 100Hz, that tend to travel through the surface layers of the Earth.“In theory, this reduction in noise means we should be able to detect more earthquakes in the UK, in Europe and all around the world,” said Baptie. If so, it would shed light on the frequency of different magnitude earthquakes and, in the case of more distant tremors, how the seismic waves are affected by the Earth’s structure and the characteristics of the shifting faults that unleash them.Researchers at the BGS now hope to check all their seismometers for the fall in human noise with the aim of producing a map that will reveal which areas of Britain have seen the most stark declines in the human hum. The hunt for smaller earthquakes may take longer than the lockdown holds, however. “We aren’t in a particularly active region,” said Baptie. “So we may not get anything in the short term.”"

In all, 271,013 people are confirmed to have recovered after contracting the virus.The true scale of the pandemic is likely to be greater as some countries are suspected of underreporting their figures.According to the country’s Department of Health and Social Care, 5,373 people who had tested positive for coronavirus have now died in UK hospitals. A total of 208,837 people have been tested for the virus, of which 51,608 tested positive, officials say.While that appears to be a slower death rate than has been seen in recent days, the way the data is being reported is skewing the picture somewhat.The accelerating American death toll closes the gap with Italy and Spain, prompting local officials to prepare the public for a high death toll.Admiral Brett Giroir, a physician and a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, told ABC’s Good Morning America: “It’s going to be the peak hospitalisation, peak ICU week and unfortunately, peak death week.”The pandemic is the biggest test the bloc has faced in its history, Angela Merkel says. “Everyone is just as affected as the other, and therefore, it is in everyone’s interest, and it is in Germany’s interest for Europe to emerge strong from this test.”Wearing masks in public could soon be mandatory in Germany, according to a draft list of measures local officials think should allow life to return to normal. The proposals reportedly include an obligation to wear masks in public, limits on public gatherings and the rapid tracing of infection chains.Boris Johnson, who was taken into hospital on Sunday, has tweeted that he is in “good spirits” after his tests.I’d like to say thank you to all the brilliant NHS staff taking care of me and others in this difficult time. You are the best of Britain. Stay safe everyone, and please remember to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.A mass antibody test is at least a month away, a leading government scientific adviser in the UK has warned. Professor Sir John Bell, from Oxford University, who advises the government on life sciences, says the search is on for an antibody test that will prove effective, but those tested so far had failed.The chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, says he is “very confident” that the UK will develop antibody tests “over the next period”, adding that it is not surprising that prototypes so far have failed.The country had recorded the fewest deaths in any day for two weeks but Monday’s figures show the numbers accelerating again, with a further 636 new deaths; 111 more than the number registered on Sunday. That brings the toll in Italy to 16,523.The number of current new infections increased by 1,941 – a rise of 2% since Sunday and the lowest day-to-day rise registered since 30 March.The latest figures released by health authorities in Greece offer a glimmer of hope. The prominent infectious diseases expert, Sotiris Tsiodras, says data suggests the country is “flattening the curve”.The country’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, says planning for the end of the lockdown is taking place, though it is too early to say when it could happen. And he warns: “The risk right now is if we take our focus off the strategy, which is beginning to work, we won’t get through this peak as soon as we want to.”"

Yet between 1946 and 2003 the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) provided a network of over 50 laboratories that were the first line of defence in major public health outbreaks. Had this network been maintained, there would have had been more laboratories available. Instead, since 2003 this network has been dramatically reduced in favour of centralisation as a cost-saving venture, which has resulted in a lack of capacity for large-scale testing.The Central Public Health Laboratory in north London (where most of the current testing is taking place) has also been much reduced in capacity, and many specialist staff have retired and not been replaced.The PHLS became internationally recognised for developing progressive methods/technologies, evaluations of kits and equipment, and standardised methods (which I led from the mid-1990s). It is time for the government and PHE to rethink how an integrated microbiology laboratory system with standardised, validated methods should be operated to have the ability to respond to outbreaks like Covid-19.Valerie BevanChair, British Society for Microbial Technology• While your editorial (2 April)(3 April) rightly challenges Matt Hancock’s “big business” explanation for Germany’s successful testing programme, the suggested need to look closely at the country’s institutional makeup only touches on the matter. Unlike the British, Germans may choose to have, funded through their insurance, annual health checks, which may involve sample testing, scans and investigative procedures. While clinicians in the UK may consider this unnecessary, and politicians too costly, the effect in Germany has been a huge expansion of testing facilities.So the German health system has fast access to a wealth of public health information that has proved valuable in the present crisis. Germany has a proactive health system, while the UK’s remains largely reactive. An effective national health service depends on an efficient national health system. At present, the UK’s doesn’t, and as a consequence has been grossly unprepared.Dr Colin ColesWinchester"

Covid-19 myths busted, 5 April), the use of face masks by the public, together with social distancing and handwashing, prevents the transmission of coronavirus and saves lives. France is the latest country to do a U-turn, joining others such as the US, Austria and Singapore in advising the public to wear them. Covid-19 is spread from aerosols (tiny viral particles); we breathe in aerosols in crowded places like trains, buses and the tube, and we touch our face inadvertently numerous times with potentially infected hands. Masks will protect against this and will be even more crucial when we ease the lockdown to prevent a resurgence of cases.The argument against mask use is incoherent. We can teach the public how to use masks properly, and ask people to use cloth masks until more medical masks are available to ensure the NHS has enough supplies.The government has a duty to protect lives by a comprehensive strategy of social distancing, handwashing, mask-wearing and protecting the vulnerable.Dr Beng GohEmeritus consultant physician, Royal London Hospital• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Only one of the Airbnb hosts it contacted said their rental was available solely to key workers, it reported.In response, the tourism minister, Nigel Huddleston, said: “Essential travel does not include holidays, leisure travel and visits to second homes - and people must remain in their primary residence.“It is incredibly irresponsible and dangerous for some property owners to be marketing themselves as ‘isolation retreats’.”One house in the Cotswolds was being offered to would-be residents as a “perfect getaway from Covid-19” with access to “long healthy walks”. Another in Brighton was advertised as a “Covid-19 safe space” that could house up to 15 guests. The name of the disease was later removed from the latter listing, replaced euphemistically by the description of it as a “deep clean safe space”, made safe “using virus-killing chemicals”.An Airbnb spokesperson said: “We want hosts and guests to follow the rules and we have no tolerance for listings that ignore health or travel advisories.“The government has set out clear guidance on the limited conditions under which necessary travel is permitted and we have taken a number of steps to support these measures, including blocking private room bookings and switching off our ‘instant book’ function for whole properties.”The government’s criticism came amid rising tensions over interpretations of the lockdown. Despite the public outcry caused by the closure of a park in south London on Sunday, the Local Government Association (LGA) said its members reserved the right to take such action again as “a last resort”.Brockwell Park reopened on Monday after many accused Lambeth council of being heavy-handed for closing it. The council said there were more than 3,000 people in the park on Saturday, “many of them sunbathing or in large groups”, but critics claimed the 51-hectare (126-acre) space was more than big enough to accommodate that number.Gerald Vernon-Jackson, chair of the LGA’s culture, tourism and sport board, said: “Councils know that parks are a lifeline for residents needing to get some exercise or fresh air and are great for physical and mental wellbeing.“This is why councils want to keep parks open, but people need to follow the social distancing advice, otherwise councils will be reluctantly forced to close them as a last resort to help prevent the coronavirus spreading.”The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he too wanted green spaces to stay open “but that will only be possible if everyone follows the rules to stay at home and not leave unless it’s absolutely necessary to do so”.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, warned on Sunday that sunbathing was against the rules and people could be prevented from leaving their homes for exercise if they did not abide by physical distancing guidelines.It emerged on Monday that since the lockdown powers came into force, West Yorkshire police have issued 20 fines, while Derbyshire police have issued 30 - half of those over the past weekend.North Yorkshire police have issued 11 since Thursday while in Bedfordshire, where the power to issue fines came into force on Friday, police have issued one.In Sheffield, police said late on Sunday night that a man had been arrested for threatening a police community support officer during a physical distancing enforcement patrol among a Roma community in Fir Vale. That followed complaints that some members of the community have not been complying with the lockdown guidelines and police have not been doing enough to enforce them, raising tensions that were already high in the area."

Mrs Kilmurray wasn’t turned away from our Wishaw store so we are looking into what may have happened and are trying to contact her,” a spokesperson said.The video was shared more than 100,000 times, but on Monday evening Kilmurray took it down from her Facebook page.In the clip Kilmurray, sitting in her car in her carer’s blue uniform, claimed: “I went in to get bread for an elderly woman who can’t come out of the house because she has to self-isolate and I can’t get her bread because my uniform doesn’t count.”In tears she said: “Do you think I want to be out here working? I’m trying to raise a family … I’m risking my life and my family’s life so get a grip and somebody do something about this.”Aldi previously announced that emergency workers - those in the NHS, police and fire service - will receive priority access at any time of the day with appropriate ID, such as an NHS card. This means they can enter the store as soon as social distancing limits allow.Aldi stores are also now opening half an hour earlier on Sunday mornings for emergency workers only."

Quite often the police are the agency who are trying to deal with that situation.”He added: “One of the difficulties we’ve got as a police service is we’re losing staff to abstractions through self-isolation or sickness, so are the mental health services, so are social services, and it’s going to be all too easy for some of these people in real crisis to fall through the gaps as we see those staffing levels come under more burden, and it’s something we can’t lose sight of.“At the moment we are coping but we’re starting to see in some areas, particularly in specialist areas, that burden starting to rise as we lose staff.”Ch Supt Paul Griffiths, the president of the Police Superintendents’ Association, told the committee that police officers were reporting an increase in mental health incidents.“We’re still waiting to see the data on the mental health incidents which we will still be dealing with, but anecdotally from our members we’re starting to see a slight increase, and if we continue to keep these isolating strategies in place there is a risk that mental health issues will increase over the coming weeks and months,” he said.“We’re well versed with what our role is in terms of supporting members of the community in terms of their mental health challenges, working with other agencies such as health and social care and local authorities. It’s a well trodden in terms of what we can do to maximise support for those individuals who are probably going to see increased and more intense pressure in terms of their wellbeing.”Griffiths told the committee there was currently an absentee rate across the police estate of 13%. The total workforce as of September last year, the most recently available official statistics, was 205,000. Thirteen per cent would therefore equate to around 26,650 staff.Answering questions from Tim Loughton, Griffiths said no forces were yet reporting a risk to service provision.He said: “The absence rate is approximately 13% across the whole of the national establishment – that includes police officers and staff. Some of those will be sick, some of them will be self-isolating with symptoms, some of them will have caring responsibilities.“Even with that capacity issue, none of the police forces are flagging up anything they can’t cope with at this stage.”• In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

As of Monday, India had recorded 4,281 cases, with 111 deaths.Dr Suhail Naik, the president of a doctors association in Kashmir that represents about 3,000 members, said the administration must take the criticism positively.“They can’t snatch this right [of free speech] from us,” Naik said."
"122","https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/06/uk-councils-face-lawsuits-over-access-to-education-in-lockdown","2020-04-06T12:16:24-0400","  UK councils face lawsuits over access to education in lockdown ","The UK government must ensure pupils from poor backgrounds have computers and internet connections during the coronavirus lockdown or face legal action for depriving children of their education, according to a group of legal activists.The Good Law Project argues that the widespread reliance on online learning during the lockdown is illegally disadvantaging state school pupils who lack access to tablets, laptops or adequate broadband. It says it will sue local authorities to try to push the government into action.The move could lead to courts forcing the government to ensure the provision of adequate internet connections and IT equipment to hundreds of thousands of children from poor or vulnerable backgrounds while the lockdown continues and schools remain closed.“Local authorities in England have a clear obligation to ensure that all children can access teaching, so there’s a very strong claim against them to ensure that they are doing so,” Jolyon Maugham, the Good Law Project’s founder, told the Guardian.“Remember that the government hasn’t closed schools down, and because they are still teaching online then children who can’t access that teaching are missing out and likely to fall behind their peers. And that’s what we want to stop happening.”In many families, children are sharing a tablet or laptop with siblings and working parents or have access only to mobile phones, while the internet access they might have had through schools, libraries or cafes has been cut off by the coronavirus crisis. Research published by Ofcom in 2018 suggested that as many as a million children and their families did not have adequate access to a device or connectivity.The Good Law Project, which has won recent court victories against Uber that could lead to the ride-hailing service being held liable for £1.5bn in unpaid tax, is to back legal action against the London borough of Southwark on behalf of parents whose children attend state schools in the area, arguing that it has failed to meet its legal obligations.“I have sympathy for the position of local authorities, who have found themselves landed with a new set of legal responsibilities to educate children remotely without matching funding from central government,” Maugham said. “Southwark is an inner-city local authority with a high percentage of children eligible for free school meals who we know to be unable to effectively access education online.”Cassie Buchanan, the headteacher of Charles Dickens primary school in Southwark, said she supported the legal action. She has been concerned at how many children at her school and others are struggling to get appropriate access to technology for learning, often because the lockdown has meant children having to share limited equipment with adults working from home.“We know from our own experience that for many families their only online access is via a parent’s phone. And we’ve designed our learning material to cope with that. But in secondary schools where the work is more interactive, these children really need to use a laptop and in many cases they can’t,” Buchanan said.Buchanan said her school of 500 pupils had about 150 eligible for free school meals, and its multi-academy trust, the Charter Schools Education Trust, was lending out computers to secondary school pupils and asking parent to donate laptops or tablets that could also be loaned out.“It’s more complex than just giving everyone access to a computer; they also have to access to broadband as well,” she said.The lawyers say the obligations under the Education Act are “buttressed” by wider national responsibilities under the Human Rights Act and the United Nations’ convention on the rights of the child, to which the UK is a signatory, which establish access to education as a legal right.The group is being advised by specialist education solicitors and two prominent human rights barristers, Caoilfhionn Gallagher and Adam Wagner of Doughty Street chambers, and is hoping to crowdfund an initial £25,000 to cover costs.Maugham said the group would call for the government to step in with funding to avoid placing a further strain on local authorities, and would write directly to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, asking him to consider the issue."
"123","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/mps-call-for-action-over-britons-stranded-in-pakistan","2020-04-06T12:04:47-0400","  MPs call for action over Britons stranded in Pakistan ","Tens of thousands of British nationals are feared stranded in Pakistan, according to the shadow minister Emily Thornberry, as more than 75 MPs demanded action in a letter sent to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab.Thornberry, a former shadow foreign secretary and now shadow international trade secretary, has been collecting data from Labour MPs who have been deluged with calls and emails from constituents. She has given Raab a detailed plan of action the party wants to see urgently enacted.Her letter comes amid growing anger that the UK’s £75m airlift operation has resulted in charter flights to Peru, India, South Africa and Nepal but not Pakistan.Osman Riaz, 33-year-old trauma surgeon at Pindersfield general hospital in Wakefield, is among those trying to get back.He said he feels that Britons of Pakistani heritage are “being classed as second class citizens”, after being unable to obtain a return flight despite numerous calls to the embassy in Islamabad.“I really hope the British government get their act together and start treating British citizens in Pakistan as equals to their counterparts in India,” he said.A businessman willing to charter a plane with landing rights and logistical support is said to have offered his support.Sam Tarry, the Labour MP for South Ilford, has spoken to him and said the offer had so far gone unheeded by the Foreign Office.With dozens of other Labour MPs, incl. @JeremyCorbyn, @HackneyAbbott, @AngelaRayner, @JonAshworth, @BarryGardiner, @GwynneMP, @NazShahBfd, @Afzal4Gorton & @RupaHuq, I’ve written to Dominic Raab setting out the action needed for tens of 1000s of UK nationals stranded in Pakistan. pic.twitter.com/3SmTokGZIbThornberry’s letter to Raab, also signed by Jeremy Corbyn, the new deputy leader Angela Rayner and 73 other MPs, spoke of those who “desperately need to get home to access their essential medicines and self-isolate safely”.“Many of these nationals are elderly, vulnerable and suffer from critical underlying conditions,” it said.It expressed “concern that the high commission in Pakistan is not adopting examples of best practice that we have seen from other embassies around the world”, a reference to the immediate efforts made by countries such as Germany and France to evacuate citizens when travel restrictions started to be imposed around the world from the middle of March.Businessman Syed Ahmed, a former director of UK Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has offered to send an Airbus 340 with landing rights and logistical support.Tarry said trying to mount a private charter was “a drastic measure” but it seemed a team of private entrepreneurs “ will be forced to act where the government has failed”.The FCO said charter flights were being prioritised for citizens in countries where borders were closed and as Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was still able to fly from the country, efforts were being directed towards the commercial option.It said 1,000 Britons had returned to the UK last week on four PIA flights with eight more scheduled this week.In relation to the offer of a charter flight it said the issue was not getting aircraft but the FCO settling on a strategy involving charter flights for countries where no other options existed.However, those left behind have blamed an “appalling” lack of communication and transparency by the FCO for stress and loss of funds as passengers scramble to get on to PIA flights which are then cancelled.Others say the government should not be outsourcing project management of emergency repatriation to an airline.Shazia Ejaz, whose elderly parents are stranded after their flights on 23 March were cancelled, said: “These are elderly people who have paid tax all their lives and never relied on the government for anything and the one time they need them the FCO lets them down, but can help backpackers in Peru which you can imagine are not the most vulnerable.”Farhan Mirza, a 35-year-old research scientist whose mother is stranded said: “I’m really disgusted by the way Mum’s been treated. The FCO seem to think everyone stuck over there is a dual national and therefore not entitled to repatriation as in other countries, so we need to explore commercial options.”His mother, Naseem, a 60-year-old social worker from Buckinghamshire, went to Pakistan on 10 March after her sister passed away only to discover her return flight had been cancelled. She has been diagnosed with low blood platelets and has said that if she is infected with coronavirus in Pakistan, she would not recover. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, promised an announcement on charter flights by the end of last week, but the information was disclosed on social media and on an update to the government website making it difficult to find for those who don’t use Twitter of Facebook or those who do not look at the gov.uk website.The update said it had organised charter flights to Bolivia, Ecuador, Philippines and India with Norwegian, TUI and Ryanair joining the list or airlines involved.The FCO has been approached for comment."

The US comic, a regular on shows including Conan, steps into character as bland-but-confident observational comic Jerry O’Hearn. And somehow he is able to create five incredibly funny minutes without once actually saying anything specific.I first saw the routine about eight years ago. There’s a YouTube clip of a bootleg recording tagged: “Jerry O’Hearn (Andy Daly) at MaxFunCon 2011.” Daly is quick to establish O’Hearn’s outlook: “All this stuff that’s going on in the world today? You gotta be kidding me!” What follows is ambiguous, meaningless standup that is nevertheless delivered with the self-righteous bafflement of a man convinced he is setting the world to rights. It’s a detail-free jaunt through every classic standup subject, running on gusto alone.The routine is not just very entertaining, though. From a nerdier technical perspective, it’s amazing to see that standup, stripped entirely of any actual content, can still be recognisable as standup. Watching that clip, with its glaring light and distant sound, one gets the pleasure of a niche discovery – of something unique, daring, clever, silly and gloriously vague.BudPod, Phil Wang’s podcast with Pierre Novellie, is available on Apple Podcasts, Acast and Spotify.Rose Matafeo: Paul F Tompkins’ Peanut BrittleWhen I was in my teens, big acts rarely travelled to New Zealand, so I enjoyed most of my standup through comedy albums I borrowed from the library or CDs bought from the shop. My favourite was the 2007 album Impersonal by the US comic Paul F Tompkins.My most listened-to track was Peanut Brittle. The entire routine is about those novelty cans labelled peanut brittle that actually contain spring-loaded snakes. The skit is completely perfect, flowing seamlessly between observations about the stupidity of the product and impressions of execs trying out new fonts for the can to keep the product relevant. It culminates in a lengthy section where Tompkins becomes a naive recipient of the can, oblivious to the prank within.I attribute most of my comedy taste and style to this routine. I learned so much about rhythm from Tompkins. Great standup requires an equal balance of strong performance and strong writing: when you see the perfect alchemy of those, it feels like actual magic. I love Tompkins for all the reasons I love comedy: he makes the obscure or niche into something relatable, with stupid voices, SHOUTING, and a celebration of shared human experience. That’s comedy, baby!Rose Matafeo’s podcast Boners of the Heart is on Apple Podcasts, Acast and Spotify. She is on Twitter @Rose_Matafeo.Tom Allen: Maria Bamford’s Celebrity HomesBack in 2006, when I was performing at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal, I was still quite naive and nervous about standup. It all felt blokey and loud. But then, backstage at a gig, I saw a comic who looked really nervous and thought: “Oh, there’s someone a bit like me.” Her name was Maria Bamford and she made me realise there were other comics out there doing material about their personal insecurities. When she talked about how she perceived the world, I found it so inspiring.I saw her Burning Bridges tour at Edinburgh that year. There was one routine, Celebrity Homes, that I particularly loved. It was based on those US TV shows about famous people’s houses that are always presented as: “I’ve got a huge house, you’d love to see it!”She did a perfect impression of those shows, then another as if they’d come to her own home, an apartment. “Let’s go sit on the futon, look through the bars on the window, and watch the helicopters circle!” It really summed up the contrast of her very real world compared to the shiny TV world often portrayed on screen.It took me a long time to learn that you need to be confident in your own insecurities for people to want to listen to them – and Bamford helped with that. Her comedy is alternative standup at its finest – storytelling from the outside looking in.Tom Allen is releasing Isolation Tips videos on Instagram (@tomindeed). He’s part of Radio 2’s Funny Fortnight on BBC Sounds.John Kearns: Eddie Izzard’s Swiss Army KnifeI first heard the Swiss Army Knife routine on the radio in my dad’s car. I was being dropped off at the cinema but remember thinking the film could wait, as Eddie Izzard went through each instrument of war on his knife one by one: “I can see you with my magnifying glass!” I was giddy with how silly it all was.His Swiss accent instantly makes you want to do one yourself: “My little saw!” I would re-enact the routine with my own penknife. How that looked out on Tooting Bec Common, I don’t know. The routine is only about a minute long yet its impact was great. When you stumble across a comedian, and are still too young to realise how famous they are, a skit can feel like it’s been tailor-made for you. It’s your secret and you’re torn between sharing it or keeping it to yourself.Swiss Army Knife is part of Glorious, a film of a gig Izzard did in 1997 that is striking for its ambition and scope. Beginning with the Old Testament and ending with Armageddon, he roots everything in the tiniest of details. On the first day God created “baked potatoes and crinkly things … very small avenues … toilets in French camping sites”.What’s so inspiring about the Swiss Army Knife routine, and the entire Glorious album really, is the amount of work that must have gone into it. Not a word is wasted, nothing is left to chance. In this great showcase of life’s tiny absurdities, there must have been hours and hours of failure before he perfected the sound of a tiny saw going back and forth. It’s a reminder to me that there are no short cuts in comedy. Only hard work can make a performance look so effortless.Microscope, John Kearns’s podcast with Mat Ewins, is on Apple Podcasts, Acast and Spotify. He is on tour later this year – for rescheduled dates, see Twitter @johnsfurcoatLou Sanders: Michelle Wolf’s Women are Their Own Worst EnemiesLast Christmas I sat down to watch Michelle Wolf’s latest Netflix special, Joke Show. About 30 minutes in, the US comedian talked about how women will never be equal with men because we judge each other so harshly instead of sticking together. That’s something I think about a lot.Wolf is surprisingly critical of women giving men a hard time. For example, if a guy is manspreading, she says, he’s not doing it maliciously – he’s just not thinking. It reminded me of when I was on a long-haul flight. I was in the middle seat with a woman one side and a man the other. The man was really dominating my space: two armrests, heavy breathing, that kind of thing. I didn’t ask him to move because I’m an idiot. I just moaned to the woman that he was in my space and rolled my eyes. When we landed, I found out they were a married couple! They’d made me sit between them, the mad twots.I’m making it sound dry, but the routine’s actually funny and wise – with lots of silly jokes about women scissoring. Since everyone is represented equally heinously, guys can’t be offended. She’s tearing us all a new one. The routine’s a manifesto, except Wolf also jokes about how the kind of people who write manifestos are wackos. So it’s not really a manifesto. It’s just good standup.Cuddle Club, Lou Sanders’ podcast, is available on Apple Podcasts, Acast and Spotify. She’s on tour later this year with Say Hello to Your New Step-Mummy.

I found it on YouTube, which is how I discovered most comedy when I was a teenager. There are few people that can do voices and act-outs so well. He does an Italian guy coming out of a cinema and telling another guy about watching Rocky.“You know what I like about Sly’s movies?” he says. “The realism.” I used to crack up every time I heard that. This dude, who’s obviously not a film critic, is trying to intellectualise the film to suit his own narrative. At times, it doesn’t even feel like it’s Eddie any more: you feel like this character has become real. He has such flair: it all seems so effortless as he makes every character feel authentic and unique. Even if they have a similar accent, they have different voices and distinctive mannerisms.When I was in school, I would do a lot of voices and impressions. I’d spend hours watching Eddie to see how he created a character. There was always a purpose to the voices and impressions: they formed a story or were part of a situation. There is no point doing impressions just to show people you can do them. What’s their purpose?It made me understand that people love things they can relate to. I’ve tried to stay true to that. I love that routine because he’s not trying to preach to you like a lot of modern comics do. It’s just Eddie Murphy being effortlessly funny.Kae Kurd is touring the UK with Spoken Kurd from October.

It was last updated at 4.45pm (GMT), 6 April.If UK nationals who are usually based in the UKare urged to return if possible:“International travel is becoming very limited as air routes close, land borders close and new restrictions are put in place that prevent flights from leaving,” the FCO website says. “We are working with airlines to keep routes open, and calling for international action to keep routes open to enable British people [to] return home on commercial flights. We are also working around the clock to support those British travellers who are already finding difficulties in coming back to the UK. If you are a permanent resident overseas, you should stay and follow the advice of the local authorities in the country you live in.”UK nationals who are unable to return home should follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise exposure. This may include remaining in a hotel room or other accommodation for 14 days; being moved to quarantine facilities; being tested for coronavirus and, if positive, in some cases being admitted to hospital. Travellers with visa enquiries or visas that may soon be expiring should contact local immigration authorities in the country or the UK-based embassy.On 30 March, the government announced it was partnering with airlines to charter flights to help bring stranded UK nationals home. Details will be published on the FCO travel advice pages and here when available. In some cases, the government may be able to offer an emergency loan to pay for flights back to the UK.The Foreign Office (FCO) is advising UK nationals against all but essential international travel. This advice took effect on 17 March, for an initial period of 30 days, but was extended on 4 April for an indefinite period. Border closures and other travel restrictions are increasing globally.Within the UK, the government is calling on people to avoid travelling at all unless essential.“Essential travel does not include visits to second homes, campsites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays.

Not taking these steps puts additional pressure on communities and services that are already at risk.”The following countries have travel restrictions in place that may affect UK nationals (who do not have residences in other countries).

But he admitted that even Wall Street’s largest bank “cannot be immune” to the economic turmoil and could be forced to suspend the dividend it pays to shareholders.The banker has previously clashed with Donald Trump after claiming that he could beat the president in an election. And Dimon appeared to criticise the Trump administration’s lack of readiness for the outbreak.“There should have been a pandemic playbook,” said Dimon.But he also pointed to much deeper, structural problems in US society that he said were contributing to the danger presented by coronavirus.“Of course, America has always had its flaws,” said Dimon. “The current pandemic is only one example of the bad planning and management that have hurt our country.”Dimon, whose cash-plus-stock pay package was worth $31.5m (£25.6m) last year, highlighted worsening wealth inequality as one of America’s biggest problems, citing the fact that the share of wages for the bottom 30% of US citizens has been declining.The JP Morgan boss also lamented poor outcomes in education, a costly healthcare system that many people cannot access, the lack of a social safety net and a poor immigration policy.“We need to acknowledge these problems and the damage they have done if we are ever going to fix them,” said Dimon, who returned to work this year after heart surgery.“As we have seen in past crises of this magnitude, there will come a time when we will look back and it will be clear how we – at all levels of society, government, business, healthcare systems, and civic and humanitarian organisations – could have been and will be better prepared to face emergencies of this scale.”JP Morgan reported profits of $36.4bn last year and Dimon said the bank could survive and keep lending, even if its most pessimistic scenarios for the effect of the pandemic on the global economy came to pass.But its dividend could be suspended in the “extremely adverse scenario” in which the US economy shrinks by 35% in the second quarter and unemployment hits 14% by the end of the year."

Trump also said the federal government had stockpiled about 29m doses.The same evening, reports emerged that Navarro got into a verbal fight with Fauci at a coronavirus taskforce meeting in the White House Situation Room on Saturday.Speaking to CNN on Monday, Navarro acknowledged the disagreement and said he told Fauci in response to his concerns about the anecdotal nature of evidence regarding hydroxychloroquine: “I would have two words for you: ‘second opinion’.”Navarro told CNN that studies including one published in the last few days involving Wuhan, China prove hydroxychloroquine can help coronavirus patients recover. Navarro said the Wuhan study was one of the first randomized in a control group.The trade adviser also claimed his PhD in economics qualified him to have such debates with health experts like Fauci.“Doctors disagree about things all the time,” he said. “My qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I’m a social scientist. I have a PhD, and I understand how to read statistical studies.”At the White House briefing on Sunday, Trump was asked if he should be “playing doctor” by pushing an unproven drug.“If it doesn’t work, great,” he said. “If it doesn’t work … it doesn’t kill people.”In March, an Arizona man died after he and his wife took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is also found in hydroxychloroquine.“Trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,” the man’s wife told NBC.The federal government has approved clinical trials in New York and given doctors emergency dispensation to prescribe the drug for coronavirus patients.Navarro told CNN that at Saturday’s meeting “there was unanimous agreement that [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] would immediately begin surging hydroxy into the hot zones to be dispensed only between a doctor and a patient decision not the federal government”.At the White House on Saturday, Trump said he might take hydroxychloroquine himself – though he would have to ask his doctors."

Reach’s top management, including the “most senior editorial team”, headed by the group editor-in-chief, Lloyd Embley, will take a 20% pay cut and all other employees will have their pay cut by 10%.The company has also suspended bonuses this year, scrapped the dividend and will no longer be publishing financial guidance.Direct cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to £2,500 a month.

Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.In addition, the board has “requested discussions” to defer payments due to the pension fund. A spokesman for the company said Reach paid £4.1m a month relating to the pension fund. According to the latest annual report for 2019, Reach had a pension deficit of £295.9m and made £48.9m in payments.“The board has agreed that all stakeholder groups should be asked to contribute to ensuring the company is in as strong a position as it can be and as a result the company has requested discussions around a deferment of current contributions to all the group pension funds,” the company said.While the company has said that everyone must play their part, Jim Mullen, the chief executive, and Simon Fuller, the chief financial officer, were paid almost £300,000 in bonuses for 2019 at the end of last month.In addition, late last month the pair were given shares worth £1.18m on the day of the award relating to the company’s long-term incentive scheme, which will vest in three years.A number of British publishers including the London financial freesheet City AM and JPI Media, the owner of the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post, have suspended printing some titles.Reach said all of its print and digital publications “continue to be produced without interruption”.“All of our key national and regional publications will continue to operate at this vital time despite these measures and we have sought to spread the burden of these actions across all stakeholder groups,” the company said.Mullen said: “It remains difficult to predict the duration and long-term impact of the crisis on our sector, so it is key we take proactive measures now on cost to protect jobs and the Reach business for the long term.”The company has £20m in cash and a £65m revolving credit facility it can utilise.DMGT, the publisher of the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, Mail Online, the i and Metro, has taken a different, innovative approach to avoid furloughing staff or making redundancies.The company, which has 2,400 staff working in its publishing arm, has asked employees to take a temporary pay cut in return for shares in the company.The scheme will see staff on salaries above £40,000 take a graduated pay cut, ranging from 1% to 26%. Staff will receive a proportionate number of DMGT shares each month until the crisis is over. At the end of the year they will be able to cash in the shares, and if the share price has dropped the company will make up the difference, or they can hold on to the shares as an investment. Those earning less than £40,000 can also participate in the scheme of they choose.“You will not have lost a penny,” said Jonathan Harmsworth (Lord Rothermere), who chairs and controls DMGT, in an email to staff on Monday. “Many news organisations are being forced to furlough staff and introduce redundancies. We have striven hard to come up with a plan that allows us to avoid these actions.”"

"132","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/06/new-renewable-energy-capacity-hit-record-levels-in-2019","2020-04-06T11:41:14-0400","  New renewable energy capacity hit record levels in 2019 ","Almost three-quarters of new electricity generation capacity built in 2019 uses renewable energy, representing an all-time record. New data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) shows solar, wind and other green technologies now provide more than one-third of the world’s power, marking another record.Fossil fuel power plants are in decline in Europe and the US, with more decommissioned than built in 2019. But the number of coal and gas plants grew in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In the Middle East, which owns half the world’s oil reserves, just 26% of new electricity generation capacity built in 2019 was renewable.The world has invested about $3tn in renewables over the past decade, according to Irena, but annual investments must double by 2030 to tackle the climate emergency.“While the trajectory is positive, more is required to put global energy on a path with sustainable development and climate mitigation,” said Francesco La Camera, director general of Irena. “At this challenging time, we are reminded of the importance of building resilience into our economies.”La Camera said the huge spending planned by governments in response to the coronavirus pandemic must support green initiatives rather than fossil fuels. “In responding to today’s crisis, governments may be tempted to focus on short-term solutions,” he said. “Yet distinctions between short-, medium- and long-term challenges may be deceptive. The pandemic shows that delayed action brings significant economic consequences.”The global oil market is in turmoil, hit by collapsing demand due to Covid-19 lockdowns and a savage price war between Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US. La Camera said: “Renewable energy is a cost-effective source of new power that insulates power markets and consumers from volatility.” Solar and wind power are now the cheapest form of electricity in two-thirds of the world.The Irena data shows the increase in new renewable energy capacity slowed slightly in 2019 - from 179GW to 176GW – but that new fossil fuel power also fell. The total green energy installed to date around the world grew by 7.6%, with the UK’s total rising 6.1%. The UK is now 11th in the world for installed renewables.New solar power provided 55% of the new capacity, most of which was installed in Asia, with China, India, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam leading the way. Other major increases were seen in the US, Australia, Spain, Germany and Ukraine.Wind power made up 34% of the total, with almost half in China and significant additions in the US. Global wind power capacity remains just ahead of solar, with 95% being onshore turbines.Other green technologies – hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal and marine energy – all grew modestly year-on-year. While small compared with solar and wind power, geothermal energy – tapping the heat of deep rocks – is growing, with Turkey, Indonesia and Kenya leading the way."
"133","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/what-are-the-uks-options-for-exiting-the-coronavirus-lockdown","2020-04-06T11:38:36-0400","  What are the UK's options for exiting the coronavirus lockdown? ","Four days ago, Boris Johnson was heralding a ramp-up of testing as “the way through the coronavirus puzzle”. His health secretary, Matt Hancock, was even floating the idea of immunity passports for people who could be confirmed as having recovered from the virus, so that they could return to work.But on Monday the government’s message was very different, following multiple reports that antibody tests were showing poor reliability. One government adviser, Prof Sir John Bell of Oxford University, said testing was at least a month away.Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said it was too early yet to be talking about an exit strategy from the lockdown. Even discussing ways out could “confuse the messaging” about the importance of sticking to physical distancing rules, he added.While ministers and their advisers might not want to discuss exit strategies openly, the Guardian here explores four options. When coronavirus first reached Britain, each suspected case was tracked down and tested. Those found positive self-isolated while their recent contacts were traced and asked to do the same. The strategy was abandoned in early March when the government changed tack from containing to delaying the outbreak. The move unleashed a wave of criticism. The World Health Organization has stressed throughout that testing, contact tracing and quarantine are vital steps towards bringing the pandemic under control. “We have got to be able to show that we can go after the virus, because lockdowns alone will not work,” Dr Michael Ryan, the WHO’s director of emergencies, said last week.Hancock has talked of scaling up tests to 100,000 a day, but there has been no official commitment to contact tracing. Despite this, both are more than likely to feature in the exit strategy. Prof Neil Ferguson, whose outbreak modelling team at Imperial College London is advising the government, said this weekend that if the lockdown sufficiently reduced new cases then mass testing and contact tracing would “almost certainly” be introduced to try to keep a lid on the pandemic.The strategy has its challenges. The UK is desperately building up its testing capacity but the expansion needed is unprecedented and other countries are competing for the same equipment and chemicals. Contact tracing is labour intensive, and scientists have called on Public Health England to recruit a volunteer army to help identify potential cases. One hope is that an NHS contact tracing app can help by sending alerts to users who come into contact with infected people. But the app has already raised privacy concerns: to be effective it would require about 40 million people in the UK to sign up and share their health and location data.In the absence of a treatment or protective vaccine, the UK’s initial approach to weathering the outbreak was to keep the most vulnerable people “cocooned” while managing the spread of infections in the rest of the population. This would build the kind of “herd immunity” that is normally created through vaccination. If more than 60% of the population developed immunity, the outbreak could be brought under control.One of the problems with the strategy is that no one knows who is vulnerable. As the deaths of doctors, nurses and young children have shown, it is not only older people or those with underlying conditions who fail to recover from the virus. This means acquiring herd immunity by letting the virus sweep through puts a staggering number of lives at risk.With the lockdown and physical distancing in place, the number of new infections should steadily fall, and unless millions of infections have gone undetected, herd immunity is unlikely to develop in the current outbreak. According to Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, one way out of the lockdown is to beef up protection around those who are known to be at risk. With intense testing of NHS workers, care home staff and others, the most vulnerable could be better shielded from the infection, drastically cutting the number of people who end up in intensive care. “That is where testing could really help get us out of this,” Woolhouse said.The lockdown and physical distancing are intended to spread the epidemic out so that hospitals do not face thousands of sick patients at once but rather a steadier stream over time. This “flattening of the curve” can save lives if intensive care units can treat and discharge the most seriously ill patients before new cases arrive. The Imperial College team that is modelling the outbreak found that the government may need to alternate between lockdown and looser rules, relaxing and then imposing the restrictions again if case numbers rebound as expected. This could potentially go on for months, depending on whether new antiviral drugs are found or a vaccine becomes available. “There is not going to be a cure for this, but if we can find a drug that works, and if we can give it to people early enough, you can stop them progressing to serious disease and needing a critical care bed,” said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia. The government has ordered 17.5m antibody home-testing kits, but none have yet proved reliable. Some senior scientists say the tests may pick up only half of those who have had the virus, in part because people with milder infections tend to have lower levels of antibodies in their blood. The poor performance appears to scupper hopes for using the tests soon to issue “immunity passports” so that the immune can return to work – an idea under active consideration in the UK and Germany. Even if accurate tests can be obtained, they may not be the “game-changer” that Johnson has claimed. No one knows whether antibodies in the blood mean full or only partial protection against the virus, nor how long any protection would last, making immunity passports a shaky reassurance.But while antibody tests might not be that useful for individuals, they could still be extremely valuable for tracking the outbreak and deciding on the best way to exit the lockdown, according to Prof Eleanor Riley, of Edinburgh University. “If antibody testing suggests that, say, 40 or 50% of the population has already been exposed, any relaxing of the social distancing rules is less likely to lead to a second wave of serious infections than if only 1% of the population has been exposed,” she said."

 This crisis has changed our experience of home – and exposed the deep pain of poor housing ","How does your garden grow? My local neighbourhood app is full of people swapping compost while my Facebook feed is full of photos of daffodils – little explosions of hope and rebirth. Who can resent that? Well, quite a few people, actually; the hashtag #selfishpricks has been trending on Twitter. The selfish pricks are people who go to parks and don’t observe social distancing. This may well be selfish, but another kind of selfishness is growing alongside it, from those who fail to recognise many people don’t have outside space. To live through this pandemic is to feel this viscerally; so much inequality is being played out.One can refuse this knowledge or fake it. Every time I see a Tory minister saying they know what it’s like being indoors all day with small kids, I catch myself thinking: “What do you actually know? Have you ever lived in a tiny flat with small kids and no garden? Do you really know what it is like not to have a tiny scrap of land where you can sit outside, set up a swing and still know you’re at home?” I lived this way with two kids until my mid-30s. The memory of acquiring a small concrete yard stays with me. To this day, I cannot garden, but to be able to sit outside is a luxury.Rumblings about a clampdown on going outside to exercise are alarming, not so much for those with gardens but for those deprived of themSure, selfish pricks exist among the various kinds of outlaws who feel themselves invincible. But there are also those who just want to get out and have nowhere else to go. In some cases the parks, the green lungs of our cities, are being shut down. High-density living is what brings us to cities and now that we must stay apart, the division between the private and public space is being played out in this bizarre inability to acknowledge that many do not have private outside space: that they rely on a communal “outdoors” that is now to be avoided and policed. It is also finally being acknowledged that home is sometimes where the hatred is. Just look at the horrendous rise in domestic violence.Cicero said if you have a garden and a library you have everything you need. I wonder if Cicero ever lived on the 17th floor of a tower block, as I once did. The recent rumblings about a clampdown on going outside to exercise are alarming, not so much for those with gardens but for those deprived of them.I use the word deprivation because the first council houses often had three bedrooms, with both front and back gardens, and only later became boxes with small windows. Socialists once thought nothing was too good for working-class people, but as a popular, mainstream notion that is now ancient history. Now people pay high rents to live in cramped studio flats and public space has been mostly commodified. Dry discussions about urban planning have excited few; it’s the results that excite people, and we rarely see those.I lived in King’s Cross in north London when it was scuzzy and magical and possibly dangerous. Now it is a giant shopping mall with an art school plonked in the middle and £5 flat whites. Sure, you can sit outside Waitrose and drink if you want to, because everything else is so expensive. Right now, it is a dead space, an unpopulated mall, a ghost town of obsolete ambition.Going out to exercise means different things to different people. The advice should have been put simply: 'Don’t sit down'Meanwhile, there are fist fights in small Co-ops. In south London, the 50-hectare Brockwell park is closed. There are those snitching on people they consider to be endangering us; the people out having a picnic in the sun could be killing nurses. The state of our mutual unravelling is not surprising when the advice has been so vague. Clearly going out to exercise means different things to different people, especially for those who have suddenly taken it up and are panting on a pavement near you. The advice should have been put simply: “Don’t sit down”.The Queen, owner of infinite space, gets on the telly to tell us we must pull together. She speaks to us from a monstrous castle. Her brooch alone could buy a lot of oxygen. The national myth of exceptionalism is regurgitated by this owner of acres of this country.The little people own no space, but we must imagine anyway: an end to this and a better life to follow. Donald Winnicott, the psychoanalyst and paediatrician, said, of his observation of children, that when we are deprived it is imagination that eases anxiety – we imagine a life beyond our boundaries and we expand.What the pandemic reveals is that the free market has led to the foreclosure of such imagination. The great writer and thinker Richard Sennett has long been talking about the relationship of social infrastructure to physical infrastructure, arguing that neither of these things can be delivered top down either by “welfare” or the market. He is right.I am looking at the space for new thinking now, at a time when the crisis has accelerated every inequality. A basic one is between who has a garden and who does not, but it is really about: who owns what? Land, streets, malls, squares?The wealthy squabble over their vistas as they always have, while our fellow citizens have nothing but four walls. The common good of lockdown means that we can finally see “the common good” is an actual space that many have been locked out of for a very long time.In The Great Gatsby, when the millionaire Jay Gatsby is preparing for lunch with Daisy Buchanan, he has the scrappy lawn of the narrator, Nick Carraway, completely removed. He prefers a manicured look. “There was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker expanse of his began,” says Carraway.The line is indeed sharp.• Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"

 Don't let free speech be a casualty of coronavirus. We need it more than ever ","In times of crisis, liberal democratic institutions and values are vulnerable to authoritarian power grabs, or corona coups, as we are seeing around the world today. One of the first victims, as always, is freedom of speech. But the current attack on free speech is particularly dangerous, because it does not only target, reasonably, “fake news” on coronavirus, but also critique of inadequacies in hospitals by healthcare workers.Repressive measures against fake news have been a popular topic for years now, having reached feverish levels in the wake of the 2016 US presidential elections. Even though the actual effects of “fake news” and “Russian interference” remain unclear and highly disputed, many mainstream politicians have convinced themselves that the spread of fake news is one of the main reasons that they are losing votes and power to populists.Social media platforms are pressured into “fighting fake news” and a true cottage industry of factcheckers has emerged – many reputable, some not. Still, too little progress has been made. This is not that surprising, though, given the daily barrage of fake news coming out of some of the most powerful political offices in the world, including Downing Street and the White House.Since the term was popularized by Donald Trump, it should come as no surprise that populists in power have enthusiastically embraced the fight against “fake news”. And now the coronavirus has given them an opportunity to intensify that fight by passing draconian new laws, allegedly to prevent fake news from worsening the crisis.One of the worst examples, as so often in recent years, comes out of Hungary, where the rubber stamp parliament has passed a set of “emergency measures” – without actually facing an emergency (as of 31 March, Hungary has officially had only 492 cases, including 16 deaths) – to give the far-right prime minister Viktor Orbán “dictatorial powers”. As Orbán rules by decree, anything that he deems “fake news” will be punishable to up to five years in prison – a death sentence for independent media, in so far as it still exists in Hungary.Perhaps even more dangerous is the attack on the free speech of people at the frontlines of the fight against the coronavirus: healthcare workers. These are the people best informed about the situation, and thus the best potential antidotes to fake news. Yet, according to the Independent, British NHS doctors are being gagged over protective equipment shortages, while NHS England has taken control of communications for many NHS hospitals and staff.In the US, one of the few western democracies without a universal public healthcare system, individual private hospitals are doing the censoring. Prioritizing their brand and profits over the health of their patients and staff, private hospitals across the US have threatened staff with termination if they speak out about the lack of protective gear. Several hospital staff have already been fired after speaking out, an incredible waste of crucial but sparse resources during a pandemic.Leaving aside the problem of employers regulating the speech of their employees, incidentally an increasingly common development (even at universities), censoring healthcare professionals is outright dangerous to the broader community. These are the people who actually have day-to-day experience with the coronavirus and risk their lives to help others – particularly if their employers don’t provide them with adequate protective gear.Free speech makes us more rather than less safe, both as citizens and patientsMoreover, we know how dangerous this type of censorship is from recent experiences in China. Max Fisher has written an excellent New York Times exposé of how China’s authoritarian structure had worsened the country’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. And western media have devoted ample attention to the tragic case of Li Wenliang, the Chinese whistleblower doctor who died of the coronavirus in February.The irony is that some of the same politicians who support, or at least allow, the censorship of healthcare professionals in their own country have been outspoken critics of the Chinese approach. For instance, the British cabinet minister Michael Gove recently blamed China for failing to stop the spread of coronavirus, while Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House foreign affairs committee, even called China’s response “one of the worst cover-ups in human history”.To ensure that we are not making the same mistakes as China, and to protect the health and lives of the heroic healthcare workers (including the many volunteers) who are putting their lives on the line every day to keep us alive and healthy, we must resist these dangerous attacks on free speech, as well as other unnecessary authoritarian measures in response to the coronavirus crisis. Irrespective of the hype about fake news, free speech makes us more rather than less safe, both as citizens and patients, even in times of a health crisis.Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia.

There are similar wage subsidies for employees.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The announcement came as Haji-Ioannou, who with his family owns just over a third of easyJet shares, demanded an emergency general meeting and called for the sacking of two directors.The Cypriot tycoon relaunched his attack on the airline’s management and its order for 107 “useless” planes from Airbus, saying his “main objective is to terminate the £4.5bn Airbus contract”.In a statement issued before confirmation of easyJet’s government loan, Haji-Ioannou had claimed that even remaining solvent until August – based on financial analysis that assumed flying would be quickly embraced again by holidaymakers this summer – could prove “wildly optimistic”.When international travel eventually restarts, he said, the airline would “feel more like a startup trying to find a few profitable routes for a few aircraft”.After news of the new financing, a spokesman for Haji-Iannaou said that it did not change the underlying situation, without cancellation of the Airbus order: “Given the current cash burn – that probably pushes the insolvency boundary back from August to late-autumn, early winter.”EasyJet is understood to be in talks with Airbus to review the £4.5bn contract and reduce its ongoing spend.The chief executive of easyJet, Johan Lundgren, said: “We remain absolutely focused on ensuring the long-term future of the airline, reducing our costs and preserving jobs, to make sure easyJet is in the best position to resume flying once the pandemic is over.”He said the airline had now reached agreements with unions to furlough UK-based pilots and crew. About 4,000 of 9,000 will be furloughed during April and May.Lundgren added: “Our current priority is to safeguard short-term liquidity … in the event of a prolonged grounding of the fleet.”EasyJet has used the government’s Covid-19 corporate financing facility, which allows UK businesses to apply for loans at pre-crisis commercial rates.The aviation sector had called for special government measures to help it survive, but the Treasury has been unwilling to assist airlines until wealthy shareholders dig deep.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said he would consider companies on a case-by-case basis, “only if all commercial avenues have been explored, including raising capital from existing investors”.However, Haji-Ioannou, whose family received a near £60m share of £171m paid in dividends last month, said: “For the avoidance of doubt, I will not inject any fresh equity in easyJet whilst the Airbus liability is in place.”EasyJet is likely to explore ways of resisting his calls for an emergency meeting, which it said would be “an unhelpful distraction”."
"137","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/lockdown-viral-trends-5g-towers-coronavirus-cases","2020-04-06T10:51:33-0400","  
 Lockdown's hottest viral trends: raging at the neighbours and torching 5G towers ","Who isn’t fascinated with infection rate graphs right now? My own loose theory is that you could use them to track much more than just the spread of coronavirus: change the label on the x axis and every one of them could easily represent data on how many people in the UK are currently getting too into jigsaws, for example, or growing very weak moustaches, or grappling with a sourdough. (The frighteningly steep lines depicting the out-of-control spread of new cases also neatly illustrate the world’s horniness pandemic – with everyone locked inside and the rising sap of spring, this is arguably the most sexually desperate moment in all of human history. Look at the graphs. The planet has never been hornier.)The graphs are also neatly tracking two other viral trends right now: “being extremely furious at your neighbours” and “burning down a 5G tower because Facebook told you to”. Both have really skyrocketed this week – we are outperforming even Italy in burning down our 5G towers! – but also have yet to reach a pinnacle, let alone a long curve down. We’ll take each one in turn.First, Neighbourhood Watch has now gone nuclear. Britain has always had a fine tradition of curtain-twitching – does any other culture have such reverence for net curtains, to comment on people’s parking, how big their weekly shop is, how often their grownup daughter does or does not visit with the kids?In lockdown, the government has given us all a gift by issuing behavioural guidelines but not actually making them sovereign – so we all get the pleasure of helping to enforce the rules. What that should mean in theory is we come together as a great neighbourly morass, pooling resources and scheduling our trips to help the infirm and the quarantined, one great big blitz spirit effort to get through this, together. What it actually means is once a week we all get furious at each other about going to the park.Even I have fallen into this trap, and I’m normal. More than once this week I’ve been out on my still-permitted daily walk and thought: “Wow, a lot of people in this park. Go home, idiots.” I have thought that thought, while in a park, presumably while other people in the park have looked at me and thought: “Wow, look at that guy in the park. Go home, idiot.”There is a divide down the nation, now. First, the Virtuous Saints, who read the government guidelines like a Bible and live by them, and get really arsey with you when you walk slightly too close to them on the pavement even if the pavement is quite narrow and they are right in the damn middle of it – and who have this sort of divine blind spot to their own presence outside, in the forbidden and unholy places.Then we have the Sinners, people without gardens who go and lie down in a park on weekends when it’s sunny or think a bike ride (which the government still deems “acceptable”) is acceptable. We all want to do our bit, I understand that. We all have a weird kink for the Keep Calm and Carry On spirit of the NHS in crisis. But I do think we’re about a week away from riots breaking out between Good Outside People and Bad Outside People.Then A&E departments are going to have to mop all that up, and the whole fracas will unflatten the curve and keep us all inside for an extra six weeks. Piers Morgan is going to do a really pink-in-the-face  Good Morning Britain bit calling them all “traitors” – and I’m going to have to grit my teeth and watch as that goes righteously viral.Our other new national sport is apparently burning down 5G towers – inspired by what even fact fans must admit is a world-class conspiracy theory, which elegantly blends our fear of disease with our fear of China and our fear of new technology nobody really understands to begin with. As the BBC reports, there have been at least three mast fires in the past week – in Birmingham, Liverpool and Melling – but the graphs tell us there are surely more on the way.Last week broadcasters were told by Ofcom that they’d face sanctions if they spread baseless 5G theories, after the community radio station Uckfield FM gave airtime to a woman who introduced herself as a “registered nurse” (who you might expect to be in a hospital rather than typing out long Facebook posts about how 5G infected bats in Wuhan with corona), who explained that 5G is somehow sucking the air out of our lungs, along with other stuff that has gained a weird traction on WhatsApp and made people harass fibre-optics engineers in the street. As a precautionary measure I went out to get some tinfoil to wrap around my head but all the shelves had been raided.There has been speculation that 5G disinformation has connections to Russia, like all the finest disinformation – as the Verge pointed out in a new report on Britain’s world-beating cellular arson industry, the New York Times warned last year that Moscow’s propaganda channels were pushing stories that 5G led to brain cancer, infertility, Alzheimer’s, autism and heart tumours. But even if the stories come from Russia, it still takes British people to believe them before a cell tower gets burned down in Merseyside.For some reason, destroying forward-thinking technology – which is also particularly useful for, say, staying in touch with people without leaving the house, which in my opinion is a vaguely useful service right now – because you’re worried about it impacting on your health, all while an unseen and real threat actually does impact on people’s health, seems to me a particularly British unreaction to this whole mess. We’re living through history, and we’re living through it abominably. Kids will be learning about this in schools, one day. Think about that next time you politicise sun exposure and set fire to a big lamppost.• Joel Golby is a writer for the Guardian and Vice, and the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant"
"138","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/europe-looks-past-lockdowns-as-us-and-japan-brace-for-coronavirus-trauma","2020-04-06T10:49:04-0400","  Europe looks past lockdowns as US and Japan brace for coronavirus trauma ","Europe’s governments have begun to look ahead to the post-lockdown phase of their battle against Covid-19 as curves on the continent flatten, while the US braces for “peak death week” and Japan prepares to declare a state of national emergency.Austria on Monday became the first EU country to publicly announce plans to lift its restrictions. “The aim is that from April 14 ... smaller shops up to 400 square metres, as well as hardware and garden stores, can open again, under strict security conditions,” the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said.If the government’s timetable goes to plan, larger shops could reopen on 1 May and hotels, restaurants and other services from mid-May, Kurz said, adding that “everything will depend” on whether citizens continue to obey draconian distancing rules this week and over the Easter break.Denmark also announced plans to start reopening nurseries and primary schools from 15 April if the number of Covid-19 deaths and new cases remain stable.“It will probably be a bit like walking the rope. If we stand still along the way we could fall and if we go too fast it can go wrong. Therefore, we must take one cautious step at a time,” said the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, adding that a ban on large social gatherings would remain in place until at least August.In Germany, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Monday that the coronavirus pandemic was “the EU’s biggest test since its foundation” and thanked Germans for following the government’s instructions. But she added that it was still too early to set a date for lifting the country’s lockdown.However, as Germany reported its its fourth consecutive daily drop in cases, a leaked interior ministry document revealed a list of measures that officials seemingly believe might allow public life to gradually resume after the end of the country’s lockdown, currently scheduled for 19 April.The measures include an obligation to wear masks in public, limits on public gatherings, and mechanisms to allow more than 80% of people an infected person has been in contact with to be traced within 24 hours of diagnosis, permitting schools to reopen on a regional basis and strict border controls to be relaxed.Like several EU countries, Austria and Germany look set to rely on mobile phone apps to trace citizens’ movements and warn them of potential risks of infection, prompting the bloc’s data protection supervisor on Monday to urge the development of a single, more secure pan-European app.Spain, which has recorded the second highest Covid-19 death toll in the world so far after Italy, also reported a fourth consecutive fall in its daily death tally as well as falls in hospital admissions and critical care cases.While strict confinement rules introduced on 14 March will remain in force until 26 April, the government announced on Monday that it is planning to widen coronavirus testing to include people without symptoms, as a first step towards slowly easing the lockdown.“We are preparing ourselves for de-escalation, for which it will be very important to know who is contaminated,” said the foreign minister, Arancha González Laya.Italy on Monday reported 636 deaths, roughly 100 more than the previous day, but its infection rate slowed again, with the number of new positive cases rising by under 2,000, or 2.1%. The health minister, Roberto Speranza, told the daily La Repubblica that the coming period was going to be hard.“There are difficult months ahead,” he said. “Our task is to create the conditions to live with the virus,” at least until a vaccine arrives.The daily death toll in France, which went into lockdown later than Spain and Italy, also fell on Sunday, to 357 from 441 in the previous 24 hours. The health ministry said hospital and intensive care admissions were also declining, but warned people it was still essential to continue respecting strict confinement measures.According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, the coronavirus has reached more than 210 countries and territories around the world, infecting 1.28 million people and killing more than 70,000. Nearly half of the world’s population is living in some form of lockdown.Among other developments:Norway said it considered its outbreak “under control” but cautioned it was too early to say if restrictions could be lifted.As 51 African countries reported 9,198 cases of Covid-19 and 414 deaths, South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called for unity and a massive aid effort.The trajectory of infections in Iran appears to have started a “gradual” decline, the government said.Indonesia recorded its biggest daily jump in cases, with 218 confirmed on Monday, while the Philippines recorded 414 new infections.Russia also recorded its biggest daily jump with 954 new cases of the disease.France is facing its deepest recession since the end of the second world war, the finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said.But if curves are flattening in Europe, elsewhere there was little sign of a let-up. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Monday the government planned to declare a state of emergency and proposed a $1tn stimulus package.Pressure has increased on the government to take action as Tokyo announced a record 148 new cases on Sunday, followed by 83 more on Monday. Japan is unlikely to introduce a hard lockdown, but the government will aim to exert strong psychological pressure through requests and instructions.The total number of positive cases in Japan has nearly doubled in the last seven days, with Tokyo the main hub. A rapid spread of the virus is a huge risk in the Japanese capital, a city of nearly 14 million, and Japan has one of world’s oldest populations, with nearly a third of the population – 36 million people – over the age of 65.In the US, authorities have warned the worst is yet to come. Officials on Monday told the country to prepare for a deadly week as the accelerating US death toll, currently approaching 10,000, closed the gap with Italy’s and Spain’s.“It’s going to be the peak hospitalisation, peak ICU week and, unfortunately, peak death week,” said Adm Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, raising the alarm in particular alarm for New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Detroit.The US total of 336,000 confirmed cases is by far the world’s largest and roughly twice as many people a day are dying in the US as in Spain and Italy.Donald Trump suggested the country was starting to see “light at the end of the tunnel”. But Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Sunday that “doesn’t take away from the fact that tomorrow, the next day, are going to look really bad”.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Monday urged governments to protect women from what he described as a horrifying rise in domestic violence as a consequence of coronavirus measures. “For many women and girls, the threat looms largest where they should be safest: in their own homes,” he said.Guterres urged all governments to make “the prevention and redress of violence against women a key part of their national response plans for Covid-19”."
"139","https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/06/maggie-ofarrell-how-disease-has-shaped-life-as-we-know-it","2020-04-06T10:41:02-0400","  Maggie O'Farrell: how disease has shaped life as we know it ","When I was a teenager, a strange rumour began to circulate around the small Scottish seaside town where I lived. Roadworks were demolishing the corner of an ancient churchyard, in order to widen the road. The site, long since abandoned, dated back to the 1600s, and contained a picturesque, ivy-clad ruin, open to the sky. It was a place much frequented by tenebrous adolescents like myself. The story was that several of the workmen had come down with a mysterious illness: fever and swellings in the lymph nodes. It was digging up the graves, we told each other, with gothic relish. They got the bubonic plague! It will spread! The whole town is going to die!It didn’t, of course. The roadworks stalled briefly, a lurid fence around them, but nobody contracted the Black Death. Slightly disappointed, we kept going to school, and life carried on much as before.Even now, whenever I pass that graveyard, the roofless church still draws my eye. And I think about those deeply buried 17th-century people, packed like tubers into the earth beyond the rebuilt wall. Did they die of the plague? Did the bacterium Yersinia pestis lie dormant in the soil for more than 300 years, only to infect some hapless workmen? Newly curious about contagion and its attendant fears, I call my scientist sister and ask her if she remembers any of this. She does but is quick to discredit it. “The bacterium would have died shortly after the person,” she says. “Digging up graves is never really a risk.”Truth versus teen hysteria aside, what is clear from this story is that our collective memory of that particular pandemic refuses to fade. The disease variously known as the plague, the Black Death, the pestilence, or the bubonic plague, occupies a potent and febrile space in our minds and in our thinking about infection. The first song you ever learned, for example. What might that have been? It could have been “Row Your Boat” or perhaps “Pat-a-Cake”, but there’s a strong chance it was “Ring a Ring O’ Roses”.The tune is eerily, maddeningly anodyne, employing the same circling three notes for the initial couplet, the words of which, some believe, are about the most devastating pandemic ever to sweep the globe. The “ring o’ roses” refers to the distinctive red marks on the skin, caused by the disease; carrying a posy of flowers was thought to ward off miasmas. The final lines – “atishoo, atishoo, we all fall down!” – are grimly self-explanatory.I have strong memories of singing it, with blithe gusto, in the classroom, in the playground, at birthday parties, at Sunday school. With clasped hands, we all formed a circle until the closing words, when the connections were broken and we threw ourselves to the floor, alone and untethered. We had no idea what we were enacting. When I was working as a teacher in Hong Kong in the mid-1990s, this rhyme came up in a textbook. With the zeal of the recently qualified, I taught it to the class, getting them to mimic me as I did the actions. I then explained what it meant, thinking that they might find it interesting. But the classroom fell profoundly silent as 20 or so Hong Kong Chinese students stared at me in dismay. Why, they wanted to know, did British children sing about something as horrible as the plague?My pupils had a point. The Black Death is no child’s play. The most infamous outbreak originated in China in 1334 and rapidly spread along trade routes, reaching Europe in 1340. It would kill an estimated 25 million people, a third of the world’s population. It continued to raise its hideous head at intervals over the ensuring centuries. London suffered a prolonged outbreak from 1665-66, as documented by both Samuel Pepys and Daniel Defoe, who was a child at the time. More than 70,000 Londoners died during this two-year period; at the epidemic’s height, more than 2,000 plague deaths were recorded in a single week.When I began to write Hamnet, a novel about Shakespeare’s lost son and his link to the play Hamlet, I knew I would need to grapple with the spectre of the plague. It was an ever present threat for Elizabethans. The shadow of this disease shaped and defined their lives. They would have been all too familiar with its symptoms and signs: the black crosses on the doors, the cries of “Bring out your dead!”, the death carts, the watchmen posted at city gates and outside infected houses, and the chilling sight of plague doctors. These were men in long robes and sinister beaked masks – the cone of which was stuffed with herbs– and armed with long sticks, used to “examine” their patients from a purportedly safe distance.In the Stratford-upon-Avon parish register for July 1564, three months after the baptism of a certain William Shakespeare, there is an entry of three words: Hic incipit pestis. Here begins plague. In the ensuing six months, just over a tenth of the town died – 237 people, four of whom lived on the same street as the Shakespeare family.Shakesepare’s working life, as both playwright and actor, was repeatedly disrupted by it. Whenever an outbreak of what was known as “the pestilence” occurred in London, almost the first thing the authorities did was to close the playhouses in an attempt to prevent the spread of infection. So, for long months, Shakespeare and his company were forced to shut up shop and tour their productions in smaller towns, in Kent or Shropshire. Edward Alleyn, while on tour in Bath, wrote the following solicitous instructions to his wife: “Every evening throwe water before your dore … and haue in your windowes good store of rue.”If the coronavirus teaches us anything it is that nothing is stable, that our situation must be reassessed every dayIn order to write Hamnet, I had to put myself inside the skin of a 16th-century mother who realises that a terrible illness has entered her house. Two or three years ago, when I began the novel, this was purely an exercise of the imagination. The concept was so alien to me, then, so out of reach. What might it have felt like, I speculated, as I sat in my ergonomic chair in my centrally heated house, to know that a fatal disease could at any moment be sweeping towards you, from far off continents? How might you react if you thought it had entered your town, your street, your house?I resorted to research: I examined maps of Elizabethan trade routes; I plotted where spices and perfumes would have been picked up, and where they might have been exchanged for furs or silks or gems; I read up on the lifecycle of the flea, and marvelled that it can live for up to a year. No wonder the disease spread so fast. I used this knowledge to write a chapter that traces the journey of an infected flea from a monkey in Alexandria all the way to a seamstress in Warwickshire.And now I find myself once more studying maps and infographics of infection. Here again are the red arrows of contagion, sweeping across lands and seas; here are peaked graphs of deaths; here are lists of symptoms; here again are people walking about cities with masks covering their faces. Except this is not the distant past, this is not the Black Death, and this is not for a work of fiction. It is, unthinkably, the here and now. It is us, our neighbours, our children, our parents. Hic incipit pestis.If this coronavirus crisis teaches us anything it is that nothing is stable, that our situation must be reassessed every day, sometimes every hour. The disease won’t reach us, we are told, and then it does. The schools will not close, we are told, and then they do. The lockdown will not happen, then it does.I’ve read that in times of trauma, the brain performs a scan for similar or parallel experiences, the better to inform itself of means of survival. Perhaps, in coping with Covid-19, we are looking to ingrained history lessons about the plague. If disease threatens to invade, these half-remembered practices are telling us, put on a mask. Shut your front door. Keep your loved ones close. Bury your dead quickly and without ceremony. Leave the city, if you can, and if you can’t, stay at home. Above all, keep going. This devastating pandemic of the past has irreversibly shaped our thinking about contagion. The plague, whether we are aware of it or not, is woven into our language, our communication, our very geographies.Why, for example, do we say “bless you” if someone sneezes – a verbal reflex that crosses all cultures and languages? Because of the Plague, a sneeze being the first sign of an illness that could end a life in 24 hours. Why do we give flowers to sick people? Because of the ancient belief that the proximity of certain plants offers protection from infection. Why are cats traditionally associated with witches? Because when cat populations rose, the cases of the plague dipped and somehow from this arose the skewed logic that cats were consorts of Satan. In his diary, Pepys noted that around 200,000 cats were killed in London, by order of the mayor. It’s not hard to imagine what effect this had on the number of flea-bearing rats. Why do we currently wear masks, like those long-ago, questionably qualified plague doctors? Advice on their effectiveness varies, but still we cling to them, almost as talismans. When conventional medicine fails us, perhaps we too are prone to fall back on superstitions and charms.The Black Death is responsible for the layouts of our cities, the very streets on which we live. Plague is a decisive town-planner, the endoskeleton of urban life, especially for green spaces. Islington Green, Golden Square, Green Park, Shepherd’s Bush Green, Vincent Square, Christchurch Gardens: all these are reputed London plague burial grounds and have remained undeveloped because of the mass graves beneath. The engineers of Crossrail unearthed some 14th-century plague graves near Charterhouse Square as recently as 2013. You can hear it in the city’s street names, too: Pitfield Street, Vinegar Alley, Pesthouse Close, Holywell Mount.My children, as yet, have no idea why an area of the Edinburgh park in which they regularly play has intriguing dips and hummocks. Up and down, up and down go the miniature grassy drumlins, said to contain thousands of plague corpses. If you build a snowman in one of the hollows, it will still be there long after all the other snow has melted, almost as if they possess their own sub-zero microclimates.It would have been unimaginable to the citizens who dug these pits that the sites would in time become leafy grounds of leisure. Equally unthinkable would have been a song about the plague becoming a birthday party favourite, just as we would find it unsavoury to picture future children singing rhymes about the pandemic of 2020. Will games be played about coronavirus, will teenagers frighten each other with tales about it, will museum displays be made of our surgical masks and bottles of hand sanitiser?Impossible to say, of course. What is certain is that, by the time this pandemic has passed, the world will be different. And so will we. Like the Black Death, Covid-19 makes no distinctions; it shows no mercy; it does not recognise borders, superstitions or, in some cases, treatment; it is the ultimate leveller.Any person who has come through a severe illness will know that the experience changes you for ever. You emerge from your sickroom as one who has passed through fire, recast, all too aware of both your frailty and your strength. In the same way, a population that goes through a crisis will also be changed, and the coming generations will inherit this sensibility. We will emerge from this but we will be different, depleted, forced to make ourselves anew. We will never be able to go back to a time before this pandemic, to a time of security and confidence, when we thought we were inviolate, immune. We will carry this with us, always; we will never be able to forget.• Hamnet by Maggie O’Farrell is published by Tinder (£20)."

 The EU can emerge stronger from the pandemic if Merkel seizes the moment ","“Europe will be forged in crises,” said Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the European Union, “and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.” What kind of Europe emerges from the coronavirus crisis will depend on the answers given to three tests.First, the Hungarian test: can a dictatorship be a member of the EU? Even before this year, Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party had so far eroded democracy in Hungary that the country would not qualify for admission to the EU if it were a candidate for membership. He has now used the coronavirus pandemic as justification to take sweeping emergency powers, allowing him to rule by decree for an unlimited period. Hungary is – for the duration of these powers – a dictatorship. Monnet also said a dictatorship cannot be a member of the European Community (which subsequently became the EU). Today, one is.The sanctions available to EU institutions are slow and complex, but there is one organisation that can and should act decisively now: the European People’s party (EPP), the hugely influential centre-right grouping to which Fidesz still effectively belongs. (Although the party is notionally suspended, Fidesz MEPs still operate as part of the EPP group in the European parliament.) The EPP should have kicked Fidesz out long ago. Instead, it has pursued a policy of appeasement. If it does not expel the Hungarian dictator’s party now, it will lose any last shreds of credibility. When EPP politicians make fine speeches about democracy, the rule of law and European values, young Europeans will be more than justified in shouting: you utter hypocrites!Next, the Italian test. Is there solidarity in the heart of Europe? Will the eurozone enable its hardest-hit member states to recover? Last month we watched with horror as one of the most highly developed parts of our continent, with one of the best health services, was overwhelmed by the pandemic. When Italy emerges from this Gehenna, it will face a huge challenge of economic recovery, handicapped by the fact it already has one of the eurozone’s heaviest burdens of national debt. Its ability to borrow the large sums needed will depend on the credibility of mutual support inside the eurozone.Even before the pandemic, Italy had gone from being one of the most Europhile countries in the EU to one of the most Eurosceptic. The crisis has exacerbated these feelings. In one poll conducted early last month, 88% of Italians said they felt that Europe was not supporting Italy, and a staggering 67% said they saw EU membership as a disadvantage. There is a European Union without Britain. There is no European Union without Italy.And finally, there is the test facing Germany: can it save the day? Will Europe’s central power finally face up to the logic of a monetary union from which it has very significantly benefitted? Germany has produced the most impressive national response to the pandemic of any democracy outside Asia. Its provision of large-scale testing, ventilators and critical care beds shows the advantages of having both good public services and a strong medical industry. Angela Merkel gave an outstanding television address to the nation – a lecture on democracy, solidarity and individual responsibility, delivered with the brain of a scientist and the heart of a pastor’s daughter. Only one thing was missing. The word “Europe” was not mentioned.In the meantime, Germany has shown solidarity with its hard-pressed European neighbours, sending consignments of face masks to Lombardy and transporting critically ill Italian and French patients to German hospitals. But it is in responding to the economic and political crisis that German leadership is really called for.Germany can help Europe pass the Hungarian test, not least because Merkel’s Christian Democrats are the most powerful party in the EPP. Now they must surely come out for the expulsion of Fidesz. All the candidates to succeed Merkel as leader of the Christian Democrats should be asked where they stand on this.It is in meeting the Italian test, however, that Germany’s contribution will be decisive. As one recent headline put it, Italy’s future is in German hands. If the eurozone – and therefore Europe – is to recover economic health, the Italian government and other southern European governments must be able to borrow money using the financial credibility of Germany and other northern European states. In the dry jargon, there would be “debt mutualisation”. Next to Italy, Spain has been hardest hit by the crisis. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has talked of the need for Europe to build a “wartime economy” and appealed for a new intra-European Marshall plan.Seven leading German economists have cogently argued that this recovery plan should include the issuance of €1tn of community bonds, jointly guaranteed by all eurozone governments. Unlike the eurobonds discussed after the financial crisis, this would be new money, dedicated to addressing the results of a disaster for which no southern European government could possibly be held responsible. To ask how precisely this support is best given would take us into the acronymic weeds of ECB, EIB, ESM and even EFSM (don’t ask). But the basic question is simple: having cast aside its own fiscal taboos (“debt brake”, “black zero”) to help itself out, to the tune of what may well turn out to be close to €1tn, is Germany prepared to do a fraction of that to help other countries in the same boat? In the case of a monetary union, “the same boat” is not just a loose metaphor. Whatever package European leaders agree upon this week, it must be big, and be seen to be big.Germany’s leading tabloid, Bild, recently published an open letter to Italy headed “We are with you!” It praised Italy for having brought “good food” to Germany and concluded: “Ciao, Italia. We’ll see you again shortly. Here’s to an espresso, a vino rosso, whether on holiday or in the pizzeria.” An interesting idea of solidarity. A few days earlier, the same paper published an article headlined “What will become of the euro? Debt mutualisation is threatened.” Dear Bild reader, what Italy needs is not your custom over a holiday espresso in Tuscany, charming though that would doubtless be, but the mutualisation of debt, as a necessary consequence of a European monetary union from which you, dear Bild reader, have benefitted greatly.There is one person in Europe who can both take and defend the necessary actions: Chancellor Merkel. Last year, I argued that Germany needed a change of government, because the grand coalition was exhausted and was strengthening the political extremes in opposition to it. That is out of the question now, in the middle of a force-10 storm. Instead, Merkel has an unexpected last chance to go down in history as a major architect of a stronger European Union. Bismarck said a politician’s task is to hear God’s footsteps advancing through history, and then jump to hang on to his coattails. That coat is passing now.Timothy Garton Ash is a Guardian columnist"
"141","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/us-rural-hospitals-coronavirus-crisis-face-shutdowns","2020-04-06T10:27:07-0400","  Coronavirus threatens survival of US rural hospitals on frontlines of crisis ","On Wednesday, Three Rivers, a small hospital in rural Washington, had exactly nine days left before it would run out of money to pay its staff and be forced to close. That same day, its CEO learned the hospital likely had its first coronavirus patient.The coronavirus pandemic has put a strain even on the wealthier parts of America’s vast, fragmented healthcare system: there are not enough beds, not enough ventilators, not enough protective equipment. But in rural communities, the stakes are different: not whether there will be enough beds at the local hospital, but whether the local hospital will be able to stay open at all.Like many American families, rural hospitals in the United States have been operating paycheck to paycheck for years, never making enough money to save up for an emergency. Now, the pandemic is threatening the survival of many rural hospitals, which would leave communities particularly vulnerable to the impact of the virus with fewer hospital beds and fewer options.At least three rural hospitals have already announced abrupt closures in recent weeks, including one in Wellington, Kansas, and two in West Virginia, leaving local residents and healthcare providers scrambling to make new plans for the pandemic.Three Rivers hospital, in a remote area of Washington state near the border with Canada, has been at the frontlines of the crisis.The hospital serves about 15,000 people scattered over 2,500 sq miles (about 6,400 sq km), according to hospital CEO Scott Graham. Its surrounding  towns are tiny: one or two grocery stores, one gas station. “We think of it as more frontier than rural,” Graham said.Three Rivers hospital had scraped by for years with a smaller-than-optimal staff and careful economizing, he said. Then, Washington became the first state with a confirmed case of coronavirus, and a confirmed coronavirus death.Once social distancing guidelines were put in place, including guidelines to stop elective surgeries, “our source of revenue basically stopped”, Graham said. Patients who would typically visit the hospital for non-coronavirus related health issues now seemed reluctant to come in. The volume of emergency room visits dropped. So did primary care. “What little cash we had evaporated,” Graham said.By late March, Graham, who had been the hospital’s CEO for six years, was starting to plan for something he had never done before: shutting down a hospital that no longer had enough money to function.On 20 March, the state’s hospital association wrote governor Jay Inslee, warning that five rural hospitals, including Three Rivers, were “facing imminent closure”.The response from Washington state officials was swift, Graham said. Within hours of raising his concerns, he was on the phone with Sue Birch, a former nurse who had spent decades living in rural Colorado and now runs Washington state’s healthcare authority.Birch said she promised Graham that they’d find a way to get the hospital through the crisis.“We can talk about closures later,” she recalled telling him. “Right now, I need you holding my front line.”Losing a hospital is a serious blow to rural communities, whose residents are disproportionately older, and often struggle with existing health conditions. While Three Rivers does not have an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), it’s a place to go for immediate care, for health problems small and large, that’s not an hour or more away. A hospital closure also has a huge economic toll, since in towns with “a school and a Walmart and a church and a post office”, as Birch put it, a small local hospital may be one of the major local employers. And it has ripple effects far beyond the rural areas the hospital directly serves.“We have to remind ourselves that we are all in this together,” Birch said. Rural areas “are where our food is produced. We urban areas need them, and they need us.”Amid the coronavirus pandemic, rural hospitals play a critical role.As urban hospitals brace for a wave of seriously ill coronavirus patients, Three Rivers has been planning to use its beds to take in the overflow of other patients from those larger hospitals, helping the state hospital system as a whole stay afloat, Graham said.While Three Rivers could provide about one or two patients with ventilators, Graham said, it does not have a formal ICU, or staff trained to work with ICU patients. But it will help take in and stabilize more seriously ill coronavirus patients before sending them to a larger hospital, with more advanced equipment, about an hour away.It can only do any of these things if its own doors stay open.The first financial lifeline for Three Rivers came from Washington state, which sent an emergency $2m out to a small group of struggling rural hospitals in March. Three Rivers got about $200,000.But keeping the hospital running costs roughly $1m a month, Graham said, with payroll for staff alone costing at least $700,000 a month. The emergency funds from the state, although helpful, only pushed the hospital’s money crisis back about two weeks.As he was trying to secure protective gear for hospital staff and prepare for an incoming surge of coronavirus patients, Graham also made desperate calls to lawmakers and journalists, trying to secure enough cash to make it through the hospital’s next pay day.Meanwhile, Birch, the state healthcare administrator, tried to work with federal healthcare authorities to open up more emergency money for rural hospitals in her state, and in others.The federal government’s lifeline for struggling hospitals, announced 27 March, would send Three Rivers and other financially vulnerable hospitals an advance of three months of their typical payments for Medicare, the federally funded health insurance program for senior citizens.That advance funding would allow the hospital to pay its staff at least through the spring and summer, until about early August. By then, Graham hopes, the virus will be more under control, and more normal hospital care, and the income from patients getting that care, will resume.Three Rivers submitted the paperwork for the Medicare advance on Wednesday, Graham said. Federal authorities told hospitals that they anticipated they could send out the payments within seven days.The next day payroll for the hospitals’ roughly 100 employees is Friday. If the payment comes as quickly as promised, he said, “We’ll be okay.”Still, Graham worries about the consequences of even a brief bureaucratic delay.That’s a fear shared by rural health experts, said George Pink, the deputy director of North Carolina Rural Health Research program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “If a hospital misses payroll once, that can be the death knell,” Pink said. “You’re telling the community and the vendors and the staff that you’re on the ropes.”At least 128 rural hospitals have shut down in the past decade alone, according to data assembled by the rural health research program.There may be more substantial federal help on the way for rural hospitals at the brink of closure. Congress’s $2.2tn emergency relief bill includes $100bn for hospitals. But how that money will be distributed and, again, how fast it will go out, is still not clear on the ground.“The details have been really, really sparse,” Graham said.Birch said she is optimistic that the safety net for rural hospitals will hold through the pandemic. Emergency payments from the federal government should come reliably within seven days, if hospitals apply for them, she said.As of Friday night, Three Rivers still had not received the Covid-19 testing results for the first patient who had been showing symptoms that had initially seemed consistent with coronavirus. Test results, like emergency funding, were still coming very slowly, when they came at all.But one thing was clear: the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across the rural county was rising. On Wednesday, it had just been three, Graham said. On Friday, it was six."

While public servants across the UK are working night and day – literally putting their lives on the line for the country – some within government are still putting self-preservation first. It is not only cowardly and shameful, it’s also destructive.”A Times article on Saturday quoted an ally of Johnson saying that Sedwill was under scrutiny for failing to control government departments. “He’s more present now but there is a bit of a mystery about where he was in the early days of all this,” the source was quoted as saying.The same article claimed that ministers were blaming PHE officials for an inflexible attitude and insensitivity to public pressure for answers. “What this has exposed is these people’s utter lack of accountability,” a senior official told the newspaper. “It’s not just PHE, it’s a whole world of these bodies that bumble along, occasionally banning Coco Pops or something but for the most part entirely out of sight.”In a following article, a “senior figure” told the Sunday Times that NHS England was being blamed by ministers for failing to get a grip on PPE supply.Civil servants have also been angered this weekend by claims that the prime minister is “extremely unlikely” to sack the home secretary, Priti Patel, even if she is found to have bullied civil servants across three separate government departments.The Cabinet Office investigation was launched last month after claims from civil servants and the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam, the Home Office’s most senior official.Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministers’ interests, is expected to pass on the findings within days.He will decide whether Patel broke rules. However, the final say rests with Johnson, who can overrule Allan.Rutnam, who resigned after anonymous briefings against him in the media, is suing the government for constructive dismissal after accusing Patel of “swearing and belittling people”.As well as witnessing Patel’s alleged bullying behaviour, Rutnam claimed he was briefed against across the media by sources said to be from either No 10 or friends or allies of Patel. He was accused of being unable to do his job and of being undeserving of his pension, and was compared to the Winnie the Pooh character Eeyore.Patel has denied the claims.One Whitehall source said: “If Patel is cleared without a thorough inquiry into the many claims of bullying, it will be seen as a whitewash and will heighten mistrust across government.”"

He and they have the love and support of the entire City family.”Manchester United and Arsenal were among many clubs domestically and abroad who offered their condolences. United tweeted: “Everyone at Manchester United is saddened to hear this terrible news. We send our heartfelt condolences to Pep and his family.”Last month Guardiola donated €1m to the Angel Soler Daniel Foundation and Medical College of Barcelona for the purchase of equipment to help fight the virus in Spain. It has killed more than 13,000 people in the country, making it one of the hardest-hit nations.Dolors was a former employee of a textile factory close to the family’s home in Santpedor about 40 miles north of Barcelona. She had four children including Pep and Pere, who is a player agent and represents his brother. One of the daughters, Francesca, is a politician who has been Catalonia’s representative to the Nordic countries.When Barcelona wanted to sign Pep as a promising young player, Dolors, along with her husband, Valenti, refused the offer before accepting the club’s second attempt.Guardiola went on to have a glittering playing and managerial career. He captained the club and was a key member of Barca’s inaugural European Cup-winning side in 1992 before managing the club to two more wins in the competition, securing a treble in 2008-09, his first season in charge.Barcelona said: “We are deeply saddened by the loss of Dolors Sala during this difficult time and we would like to express our most heartfelt condolences, especially to Pep Guardiola, his family, and his friends. Rest in Peace.”Bayern Munich, whom he coached between 2013 and 2016, tweeted: “Dearest Pep, everyone at FC Bayern is mourning with you and your family.”"
"144","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-latest-pm-face-ill-health-during-national-crisis","2020-04-06T10:17:49-0400","  Boris Johnson is latest PM to face ill health during a national crisis ","Prime ministers do not aspire to infallibility or immortality, but a display of mental or physical frailty at a point of national crisis is something any Downing Street spin doctor would dearly wish to avoid, and if possible suppress.The impression of the ship of state adrift, and the helmsman heading below deck, pleading illness, hardly inspires confidence, however much personal sympathy in this case is felt towards Boris Johnson. With questions being asked about the government’s lockdown exit strategy and Labour revitalised by a new leader seeking to make a mark, No 10 needs to be at its most coherent and decisive.It is also a concern if Johnson as adjudicator is absent just as Whitehall jostling starts between those putting either the interests of the nation’s health or its economy first.But the infectiousness of this virus made it practically impossible for Johnson to hide from others in No 10, and the public, that he had contracted it. Once the decision was made for Johnson to go to hospital, No 10 went public within two hours. Little other option was available. Rumours had been circulating for days that his recovery was not under way, highlighted by the return of the health secretary, Matt Hancock.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 69,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.One person closely involved said: “The difficulty is that the crisis is so all-enveloping, the PM could not stop working. No one likes to think they are dispensable. The first step was to get him to admit to himself how ill he was becoming. What was subsequently admitted to the nation was a second order issue”.Even now No 10 is reluctant to go into detail on the prime minister’s health, stressing in its statement that the hospital admission was simply a precautionary step to undertake tests, rather than an acknowledgement that he had deteriorated. He would continue to be briefed at his hospital bed and was very much in charge.By contrast, Donald Trump in opening his Sunday press conference provided a dramatic, possibly melodramatic, medical bulletin on Johnson’s health, offering the US’s prayers to help Johnson in “his personal fight with the virus”. Trump has a relationship with the truth that could be described as sometimes adjacent, but he did not give the impression that Johnson was going to hospital for routine tests.If No 10 is being economical about a more serious illness, it would not be the first time the public has been misled by a serving prime minister about his health. The UK may be at war with an invisible virus, but British prime ministers at times of conflict have always been reluctant to admit they have been incapacitated. David Lloyd George in 1918 suffered a bout of influenza so severe his valet said it was touch and go whether he would survive. Medical bulletins at the time made no suggestion he was in any danger.Andrew Bonar Law resigned in 1923 only on receiving a diagnosis of terminal throat cancer, and Henry Campbell-Bannerman, prime minister from 1905 to 1908, died days after his resignation in 10 Downing Street.During Winston Churchill’s two wartime illnesses, the full extent of them was never revealed. In February 1943, after the then 69-year-old contracted pneumonia, his personal physician Charles Wilson drafted a bulletin, but Churchill immediately demanded to see it. He dismissed it as “alarmist” and liable to cause confusion and despondency and was, in any case, untrue.Churchill, therefore, dictated his own bulletin, but Wilson said it was inaccurate and misleading and he could not possibly sign it. Elaborate textual negotiations led to a compromise, and subsequent bulletins always referred to his improving condition.A further bout of pneumonia in August 1944 was not publicised at all, and according to his wife, Clementine, only the smallest circle was informed.Similarly, the cocktail of drugs being taken by Anthony Eden during the Suez crisis was known only to a few, and even now the impact on his judgment is a matter of dispute.But these were more discreet times, and the ruling class could form a small circle of trust. That in turn made it easier to put out bland medical bulletins that disguised more than they revealed.The White House has been equally skilled at suppressing the truth about its president’s health. Franklin D Roosevelt famously had polio, Dwight D Eisenhower had both a heart attack and a stroke while in office. John F Kennedy suffered Addison’s disease, hypothyroidism and severe back pain, none of which was publicly disclosed during his lifetime. Grover Cleveland in 1893 even had a secret operation to remove a cancerous growth that took place on a boat, dressed up as a fishing trip on a lake.The fear that power, credibility and respect will seep away if ill health is revealed remains. Not just the electorate will lose faith, but your cabinet colleagues may sniff a succession. Tony Blair was reluctant to reveal his heart issues for fear allies of the the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, might take advantage.Hillary Clinton was hammered when she contracted pneumonia, and wobbled in front of the TV cameras when walking to a car. In 2016 news of her illness received 13 times more coverage than revelations about fraud in Trump’s charitable foundation. Bernie Sanders has frantically denied his heart attack makes him the weaker of the three septuagenarians seeking the presidency.But outright suppression of the truth in modern politics has its downsides. Figures such as Peter Mandelson, Gordon Brown’s chief communicator after the financial crash, have warned the prerequisite for national unity at a time of genuine crisis is a government that levels with the British public about the difficulties the Whitehall machine is facing. There will come a point when, if Johnson’s condition is serious, the medical and spin doctors will have to tell the public as much."

Owing to the slow rollout of 5G in the UK, many of the masts that have been vandalised did not contain the technology and the attacks merely damaged 3G and 4G equipment.There is hope that the rate of attacks may now be slowing. Network operators are particularly concerned about the safety of their staff, as members of the public have confronted telecoms engineers maintaining critical infrastructure, sometimes filming the encounters to share on social media. Mobile operators and home broadband providers estimate there have been at least 30 such incidents in the last week.Engineers for O2 have been issued with signs to display in their vans while working. The signs, which read “Key worker, keeping your network running”, are intended to spread the message that communications workers are playing a crucial role during the current crisis.Social networks will meet the government in the coming days to explain what they can do to stop the spread of baseless claims about 5G, although there is a limited amount that can be done to stop videos and messages spreading on messaging services such as WhatsApp.Despite repeated assurances from international radiation watchdogs that 5G is safe, baseless theories about its purported risks have long bubbled away at the fringes of the internet – in common with previous generations of the telecoms technology. However, the rapid explosion over the last week of claims linking the new telephone standard to the pandemic – fanned by some celebrities and influencers – has caught the industry and the government off guard.While many long-running Facebook groups have opposed the rollout of 5G technology, in the last week the social network has had to delete multiple pages encouraging vandalism of the phone network. The number of attacks rose rapidly following a suspected arson attack on a mast in Birmingham on Thursday night. Vodafone confirmed that six sites were targeted over the weekend, and other networks suggested they had seen similar numbers.MobileUK, the industry group that unites the UK’s four main mobile networks, published an open letter to customers asking for help to stop the vandalism.“We have experienced cases of vandals setting fire to mobile masts, disrupting critical infrastructure and spreading false information suggesting a connection between 5G and the Covid-19 pandemic,” the open letter says. “There is no scientific evidence of any link between 5G and coronavirus. Fact.“Please help us to make this stop. If you witness abuse of our key workers please report it. If you see misinformation, please call it out. Your help will make a real difference.”"

 Why are some in government wasting time briefing against the civil service? ","As the government struggles to get a grip on the most significant public health emergency in a century, institutions and occupations previously subjected to acrimony, neglect or simple disregard have in the space of a few short weeks become the nation’s saviours. From the BBC to bin collectors, shop workers to care home staff: all have suddenly been recognised as vital and appreciated by public and politicians alike.However, as pressure mounts over the capacity for coronavirus testing and the supply of personal protective equipment and ventilators, finding someone to blame rather than fixing the problem seems to be the priority for some at the heart of government. Well-placed anonymous sources have started pointing fingers at everyone from the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to Public Health England.They “bumble along, occasionally banning Coco Pops or something, but for the most part entirely out of sight” is how one source from within government described some of the most senior public health professionals in the country. Elsewhere, an unnamed minister has been happy to lay the blame for the lack of testing at the door of Public Health England, while a “senior figure” was busy pointing the finger at NHS England for a “system” that had given “incorrect” and “overly optimistic” information to ministers. Imagine being on the frontline of planning for a pandemic, knowing the consequences of the decisions you’re making while potentially risking your own health, then seeing that this is what some within government think of your work.For four short weeks, the briefing war against the civil service that had characterised the government before coronavirus had abated. Witnessing the incredible response of the service, I had hoped that this government would not return to some of the bad old ways. From the job retention scheme, repatriating travellers abroad and processing an extra million universal credit claimants, to those trying to understand and plan for the consequences of this virus: this list is endless, and mostly unseen.The service itself has also had to completely reorganise, with hundreds of thousands of staff working remotely and in different ways to keep vital public services functioning. Many are also on the frontline, because some public services simply cannot be delivered remotely, and we’re witnessing the first tragic consequences of that necessity.If mistakes have been made, ministers and civil servants will rightly be held accountable. Every government in the world has been overwhelmed by this virus and will have made major mistakes – some avoidable, some not. While ministers and officials must be scrutinised for their decisions as events unfold, many of these questions will inevitably be for another day.Right now, we need ministers and their advisers focusing on saving lives, not their careers. While public servants across the UK are working night and day – literally putting their lives on the line for the country – some within government are still putting self-preservation first. It is not only cowardly and shameful, it’s also destructive.• Dave Penman is general secretary of the FDA union, which represents civil servants"

 With Boris Johnson in hospital, government is adrift ","Boris Johnson is ill and in hospital. That must be wretched for him and his family. We can only wish him well and a speedy recovery. His infection by Covid-19 indicates the extraordinary contagiousness of this disease and possibly its widespread prevalence. Of the first there is now no doubt. Of the second, without testing, there is no clue.That a prime minister is ill is a serious matter. Yesterday the Queen performed her duty as the nation’s figurehead with remarkable assurance. In clear, undramatic language, she spoke free of cliche and with sincerity. Her few words of hope shone through the darkening forest of the media coverage of these events. It was the first time I smiled at the television in a month.A prime minister too is a figurehead, but has a harder task. Johnson is the nation’s elected leader at a time of crisis, with millions reliant on his decisiveness, judgment and public demeanour. At least one cabinet minister maintains that these qualities can be deployed from his hospital bed. Sometime soon, that idea will become absurd. It presents the government machine as a driverless car which, in the style of Yes Minister, will perform equally well, if not better, with no politician at the wheel. Leave the experts and “the science” to get on with it, and all will be well.Rumours abound that since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, this machine has been ramshackle. The nation’s health services, so proudly championed for so long, were unprepared both centrally and locally. This was despite trial runs and forewarning. It does not matter who was to blame. The system malfunctioned. Then in mid-stream the cabinet reversed its policy from mitigation to suppression. Ministers ran in and out of Downing Street press conferences, making pledges, setting targets and micro-managing social distancing. Little of what they said carried full conviction.Suddenly, leadership mattered. Who was in charge? Johnson’s initial glib Churchill imitations (the Queen wisely chose Vera Lynn) had to change, and they did. As Johnson fell ill, news conferences were conducted by the dull, steady Dominic Raab or the flashy, impetuous Matt Hancock. Experts came and went, spurring debate as to what side they were on.Government lurched into lecture mode. It began telling people not to work, how to shop, and where and with whom to walk. These are not the normal actions of government in a free society. They are painful and massively intrusive on daily life. They are also being taken by ministers and officials amid extremes of risk and uncertainty. The instinct under pressure was not to welcome argument or accountability. It was to demand obedience.That is not enough. At the very least the use of such powers requires the most explicit public leadership. Bluntly, they need the qualities of communication for which Johnson was supposedly elected. They also need ready scrutiny and challenge, which is currently being supplied only by the media. Parliament has abandoned what should be its primary role: holding executive decision to account. The new Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, was therefore right to refuse Johnson automatic support.The cabinet cannot operate with half its members in varying degrees of isolation. The wonders of Skype and Zoom cannot replicate the cut and thrust, the body language, the public and private exchanges of a truly deliberative forum. There has to be a conductor knowing when and how to bring the instruments of government into play. There has to be a boss.Past experience of sick leaders is not happy. Churchill’s doctor, Lord Moran, and his wartime aide, Lord Alanbrooke, related the impact his clinical depressions had on war cabinet morale. The same message came through the 2008 study of sickness in power by the former foreign secretary, David Owen. He traced the hubristic impact that power can have on those who wield it, not least a refusal to believe they might be ill.Democracies vote for leaders, not anarchists. Every leader’s style is different. Attlee could hardly have been less like Churchill, Heath less like Thatcher, Brown less like Blair. All depended on their close relations in Downing Street with advisers and cabinet colleagues – and suffered when these broke down. Johnson decided from the start that he would not harbour critics in Downing Street, preferring the second rate to the second thought. He made his own indispensability a feature of his rule. In normal times, that is unwise. In a crisis it is stupid.Britain’s present predicament is yielding lessons aplenty. One is that the formal machinery of government matters. Johnson’s response to coronavirus has been to nationalise, standardise, command and control everything. In his lockdown, one rule must fit all. Such is Britain’s centralist constitution. But if so, it must depend on one thing: efficient and accountable leadership. At present the prime minister is clearly unfit. A public and functioning alternative must surely be in place.• Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

"149","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/trump-polls-coronavirus-support-midwest-voters-why-popular","2020-04-06T09:40:52-0400","  'Trump is leading': the midwest voters lapping up president's daily briefings ","Holly Rasmussen is not one to pay much attention to the detail of politics, and certainly not to sit through presidential press conferences. After all, she has a business to run. Or used to.But in recent days, Rasmussen, who lives in northern Iowa, has been drawn to Donald Trump’s widely scorned daily television briefings, and she likes what she sees.“I think he is staying extremely optimistic and I think that’s what a lot of us need,” she said. “I think he’s leading. And this is an unprecedented time to do the best he can without having more people die and the economy completely tank.”Rasmussen is one of those voters who swung from Barack Obama to Trump and then stuck with the president because she reckoned he was doing a good job with the economy. Now, as coronavirus destroys lives, jobs and businesses – and threatens to drive Rasmussen’s cosmetology school to the wall – she is among those Americans who have bumped up the president’s approval ratings even as he faces a barrage of scorn over his handling of the pandemic.The latest Gallup poll gave Trump the highest approval numbers of his presidency, bolstered by swing voters, independents and even some Democrats.The poll is no more than a snapshot in a rapidly evolving crisis, and opinions may change radically in the coming weeks as the death toll rises and the loss of jobs bites deep.In addition, Rasmussen lives in the small city of Cresco close to Iowa’s northern border with Minnesota. Like much of the midwest, it has yet to be badly hit by the virus and attitudes to the president’s handling of the crisis may shift against him when it is.But for now, towns and cities across the region are watching the approach of coronavirus with fearful resignation, and many there are prepared to give Trump the benefit of the doubt for now.In southern Missouri, Cindy Anderson – doing her job in the payroll department of a mental health counselling service from home – worries that when the virus finally hits, small cities like Kennet will be woefully unprepared not least because its only hospital closed a few months ago.“I think we’ve been forgotten about in a little part of the world because we’re rural. Unfortunately, the area in which we live, there is a lot of poverty and a lot of sick people. When it hits, I’m sure that it will be devastating,” she said.For all that, Anderson thinks Trump is making the best of a bad situation even if he has made mistakes. “I don’t know if he’s got it right, but I think he’s trying. I think he’s effective,” she said.But the 65-year-old is frustrated at what she regards as politicised attacks on Trump over his actions, or lack of them, early on in the crisis when she says the focus should be on how to get through this.“I think that a lot of the news media, they don’t tell the whole story. They tell the piece that sounds the most damning and they don’t add the other piece,” she said.That’s a view shared by Rasmussen.“I would rather have just the issues of what’s going on with the coronavirus and what they are doing to help us then just nit picking stuff that I was seeing,” she said.Rasmussen is critical of the scorn poured on the president when he hesitated to call for businesses to close because of the economic impact. She said his concerns about the financial consequences were legitimate.The shut down required Rasmussen to close her cosmetology school, leaving her workers without pay and her school facing bankruptcy if the shutdown lasts more than another two months. She agrees that it was necessary to order non-essential businesses to close but as someone who supports the president principally because she thinks he is good for the economy, she is judging him in good part over how he handles a crisis potentially much more severe than the Great Recession of a decade ago.From that perspective, Rasmussen sees a president who, alongside Congress, has been decisive in trying to help ordinary Americans and businesses. Some in the midwest contrast the $2.2tn rescue package, which includes payments to taxpayers, with Obama’s response to the financial crisis by rescuing the banks but not ordinary people losing their homes to foreclosure.“I was actually shocked when I first started hearing about the (rescue) plan. I thought this is unprecedented. I can’t believe Republicans actually are going for that at all,” she said. “Like, wow, I am completely shocked on that. I really am.”To Rasmussen that looks like leadership. She regards Trump’s much derided claim that distancing strategies could begin to be lifted by Easter as aspirational.“It’s him trying to stay optimistic, I thought that was good. It’s hopeful for people. He was trying to put an end time to this which I didn’t think was the worst thing in the world. And he he took a pretty hard hit for a lot of that,” she said.That’s not how it’s seen by some of those confronting the pandemic.Ashly Moore works as an occupational therapist at a hospital in Des Moines, Iowa. She is still seeing patients at some risk to herself because only those showing symptoms are tested for coronavirus.“It is worrying but there’s not a whole lot you can do about it. And I’m happy to have a job. A lot of people right now are experiencing layoffs and uncertainty. You just take all the precautions that you can,” she said.Moore said she understands that the pandemic has evolved fast but she does not see leadership from the White House from a president who previously described the growing coronavirus threat as a hoax and then gave himself full marks for handling the crisis. “I tried to be patient and have understanding that to be a president or to be in any kind of position during this type of a crisis is terrifying. You’re criticised no matter what you do. But he has blatantly downplayed the seriousness of this,’ she said.“He’s obviously concerned about the optics. He’s concerned about his re-election. But if you truly care about leading a nation in a time of crisis, your own re-election really shouldn’t be on your radar. It’s very selfish and egocentric to make that a priority right now.”Rasmussen though is not alone in the rural midwest in seeing the president’s shifting position as a reflection of her own uncertainty. At first, the numbers of deaths from coronavirus, compared them to lives claimed by flu, opioid overdoses and car crashes did not look startling, and some wondered if the threat was far away and overblown. Rasmussen came to accept the scale of the crisis as she listened to friends and relatives working in health care in bigger cities.“I myself was thinking, coming from a small community, you don’t see this. But I do have a lot of people in bigger cities that are in health care and hearing some of their stories about not having proper PPE and masks and things, then it started getting a little bit closer to home,” she said."
"150","https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/06/french-writers-corona-getaways-prompt-backlash-leila-slimani-marie-darrieussecq","2020-04-06T09:39:37-0400","  French writers' coronavirus getaways prompt backlash ","Leïla Slimani and Marie Darrieussecq may be two of France’s most acclaimed writers – but their accounts of life in lockdown in their second homes in the countryside have unleashed an outpouring of resentment among French readers, with one fellow writer even comparing Slimani to Marie Antoinette.Slimani, who won the Prix Goncourt for her bestselling novel Lullaby, wrote in Le Monde of how she had left Paris and sequestered herself and her children in their countryside second home since 13 March, telling them that it was “a bit like Sleeping Beauty”. “Tonight, I couldn’t sleep,” she wrote. “Through my bedroom window, I watched dawn break over the hills. The icy grass, the lime trees on the branches of which the first buds appear.”Darrieussecq, meanwhile, wrote in Le Point of how she hid her car with Paris number plates in the garage after arriving at her second home, using the older car that she keeps there to get around because “I feel it’s not good to drive around with a 75 on our behind”.“Two hinds graze in our fallow garden,” she continues. “We go to see the sea. It beats, heavy, strong, indifferent. The beach is deserted. I have a vision of a planet without humans.”As rural France turns its back on Parisians fleeing to the countryside, accusing them of spreading coronavirus, and while police checkpoints are set up to prevent city-dwellers from leaving to go to second homes during the Easter holidays, Slimani and Darrieussecq’s pieces received a less than warm reception from readers and fellow writers.“Hey poor people,” tweeted the journalist Nicolas Quenel. “Is all well in your 15m apartment for three? To pass the time and take off the pressure of confinement, you can always read the journal of a writer in her family home in the countryside.”In Brain, Félix Lemaître wrote that contemplating the horizon, as Slimani does in her piece, is a “class privilege”, and that the author’s photos of her country idyll have “a little taste of porn, of obscenity, for all those whose vision for the next few weeks will boil down to an inner courtyard or the building opposite”.The Lullaby author’s experience of confinement in her half-timbered house in the countryside is “in a parallel universe dreamed up by the Grimm brothers”, wrote author Diane Ducret in Marianne.“At the very least, we are not having the same experience. If for Leïla Slimani, confinement is like a fairytale, for me it is more like a picaresque novel. I am the picaro, of low social rank, without honour or marginal, yearning for freedom and hoping to survive by being resourceful,” wrote Ducret, adding that “Marie-Antoinette playing farmer in Trianon [in Versailles] could not have been further from the fear, the anguish of the people”.“Our intellectual elites sometimes seem to me ungrounded, as if the French revolution did not take place in all areas, and that only a certain social class was authorised to express the taste of the time,” Ducret wrote.“From my window, you can’t see the sky. The building opposite is dirty, the empty streets fill me with roaring anxieties. Being stripped by a virus in my 30s, dying alone, perhaps, in a two-room apartment, tempts me only moderately. It would have been less of a seller than the golden hills and camellias of Leïla Slimani, but it would have been more representative of what we are experiencing.”"

No problem! 23 cake recipes for when you're missing an ingredient ","Cake has taken on a new significance now that most of us are stuck at home all day, every day. We’re comfort-eating and baking like there’s no tomorrow. But what do you do when you fancy a sponge, but can’t find eggs or your oven is broken and no one will fix it? Here are some recipes to get you through every ingredient shortfall.If we suggest you replace one missing ingredient with another that you don’t have, or that you would normally never dream of buying, bear in mind that no two kitchen cupboards are the same and you may find that grocers can still supply “fancy” alternatives such as ricotta or flaxseeds while the staples are but a memory.You can make any cake that calls for self-raising flour without it. Nigella Lawson doesn’t even bother keeping any, as she explained a few years back. As long as you know the ratio (2 tsp baking powder to 150g plain flour), it’s easy to make some. There are a lot of decent bakes that include this process in the method, from Dan Lepard’s sour cream butter cake (billed as the easiest cake in the world) to Claire Ptak’s picture-perfect raspberry vanilla sandwich.Baking powder isn’t the only way to get some rise into your bakes. German yeasted cakes are a wonder – wholesome and weighty; as close as a sweet can get to lunch, and all the better for it. If you’re baking bread, set aside a bit of the leavened dough for Felicity Cloake’s perfect plum cake, German baking expert Luisa Weiss’s Apfelkuchen or the myriad other cinnamon, cardamom and honey-scented options to be found elsewhere.In one of her more daring moves, Anna Jones makes a lemon cake with cannellini beans, ground almonds and four eggs. It is a stone-cold winner – fudgy, rich and sweet. For something more decadent, try the classic flourless chocolate cake. The recipe I have used for years is as follows: melt 200g butter with 100g dark chocolate over a bain-marie, then mix four egg yolks with 100g sugar, and fold that into the chocolate mix. In another bowl, beat the egg whites into stiff peaks, gradually adding a further 100g sugar, then fold into the chocolate mix and bake in a buttered tin at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas mark 4 for 45 minutes or until set in the middle. Serve with whipped cream, Greek yoghurt or creme fraiche – if you have any – and a dusting of icing sugar.Bakers keen to avoid refined sugar have plenty of options, such as syrups (maple, agave, date), fruit (dried and fresh) and sweet root veg (carrots, sweet potato). Nadia Lim does a beautiful banana loaf with coconut. Leela Cyd does one with dates. But having no sugar in lockdown times may call for a more 1950s approach. In her new book, Oats in the North & Wheat from the South, Regula Ysewijn makes a very old-school slab of parkin using only tinned sweeteners: heat up 200g golden syrup with 45g treacle and 200g butter, then mix in 200g oat flour (just blitz up some oats in a food processor if you have none), another 100g oats that have been less finely blitzed, 2 tsp each of bicarb and ground ginger, a pinch each of nutmeg and salt, one egg and 2 tbsp whisky (or milk). Bake at 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas mark 3 for about an hour then leave it to cool in the tin. (As an aside, Ysewijn says: “Never fan! Fan is super-evil and should be avoided at all times!”)If your stockpiling involved stashing away a tin of Nestlé Carnation instead, you could opt for this recipe from Australia (although obviously you won’t want to sprinkle icing sugar on top).Vegan bakers have a few tricks up their sleeves. Mix 1 tbsp chia seeds or milled flaxseeds with 3 tbsp water and set aside for 15-20 minutes, and you have what’s known as a vegan egg, which generally works as a direct swap-in, say, for a brownie or a loaf cake. If your recipe calls for whipped-up egg whites, as it may for an airy sponge, you can (with some effort) whip up aquafaba (AKA chickpea brine) into frothy white peaks. Again, 3 tbsp is the equivalent of one egg and 2 tbsp for an egg white; Anna Jones tells you what to do here.Or take a tip from Ruby Tandoh’s moist chocolate fudge cake. Where most recipes caution that you should not overmix the batter once you have added in the flour, Tandoh’s solution for not using eggs is to do exactly that. You flavour the mix with sweet spices, sweeten it with dates and brown sugar and then beat it for a good minute to give it some structure. Once baked, it is slathered with a mix of melted dark chocolate and golden syrup.This one is easy. Use olive oil. Ideally you’d make Maialino’s version with Grand Marnier and orange, but Rachel Roddy does an excellent stand-in with ricotta (which you could replace with strained full-fat yoghurt) and lemon. The citrus or dairy gives the bake a good tang, but I would happily eat a really basic one, too, flavoured only with vanilla essence (such as this Kim Boyce recipe, only using plain flour and without the chocolate or rosemary.) And then there’s the similarly basic French gateau au yaourt. Clotilde Dusoulier’s version calls for vegetable oil, but I’ve tried with the dregs of many bottles, and it’s always a winner.The beauty of yoghurt lies in the fluffy, tangy, moist crumb it fashions, with or without added fat. Thomasina Miers’ version uses Greek yoghurt, four eggs and a remarkably tiny amount (35g) of plain flour, with lemon, pistachio and cardamom for flavour. The BBC, meanwhile, lists an entirely fatless sponge (filled, with delicious irony, with a huge amount of whipped cream) that is so striking it deserves a try.Another doozy. If you haven’t tasted a clementine cake, like the one with which Ben Stiller’s Walter Mitty wins over hostile Afghan warlords, you simply haven’t lived. I love the fact that using the whole fruit brings bulk, liquid and flavour. Nigella’s recipe is my go-to: boil up four clementines (I’ve done it with a couple of oranges, too), then blitz them to a pulp. This is then used as the base for a batter of egg, sugar, ground almonds and a little baking powder.Meera Sodha’s superlative chocolate, olive oil and passion fruit cake would fit several categories here, featuring neither eggs, dairy nor raising agent of any type. It’s a treasure of a recipe. Ysewijn suggests Cornish heavy cake (also in her new book). Essentially a giant rock cake, it has been made since well before there were things such as self-raising flour; her recipe dates from 1920. You roughly mix 50g each of butter and lard with 340g plain flour, 50g sugar and a tsp of salt. Pour in 125ml of milk or water and knead to combine, before adding 180g currants and 50g candied peel and kneading again. The dough is then set aside for an hour or two, before being baked in a tin, sprinkled with sugar, at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas mark 5 for 40-50 minutes.This should be where your cake plans hit a wall. But no. No-bake fridge cakes are a thing, and Cloake’s perfect no-bake cheesecake is hard to beat: a base of buttery, syrupy cornflakes, a filling of lemon-spiked cream cheese and ricotta, a two-hour chill in the fridge. Cornflakes! Of course you’re making this right now."
"152","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/former-world-officials-call-on-us-to-ease-iran-sanctions-to-fight-covid-19","2020-04-06T09:00:00-0400","  Former world officials call on US to ease Iran sanctions to fight Covid-19 ","A group of 24 senior diplomats and defence officials, including four former Nato secretary generals, have urged Donald Trump to save “potentially hundreds of thousands of lives” lost to coronavirus across the Middle East by easing medical and humanitarian sanctions on Iran.The call has the backing of the former EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini, the former director general of the World Health Organization Gro Harlem Brundtland, and senior American diplomats in the Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations.Trump reimposed crippling sanctions on Tehran in May 2018 after withdrawing from an international deal that put curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme.The bipartisan group is not pressing for a generalised lifting of the sanctions but instead a targeted effort to ease US rules that prevent Tehran trading in medical and humanitarian goods. The group says the move “could potentially save the lives of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Iranians and, by helping to curb the virus’s rapid spread across borders, the lives of its neighbours, Europeans, Americans and others”.Iranians are facing “one of their country’s darkest times in living memory” the group says. “Reaching across borders to save lives is imperative for our own security and must override political differences among governments,” it adds.Signatories include the former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright, former US defence secretaries William Cohen and Chuck Hagel, former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency Hans Blix, former US treasury secretary Paul O’Neill, the former US lead diplomat on the Iran deal, William Burns, and the former Nato secretary general George Robertson.Centrist and progressive Democrats including Joe Biden have all called for a lifting of sanctions, but the statement – organised by the European Leadership Network and the Iran Project – is the most broad-based effort to engage the White House yet,proposing very specific, but effective steps that do not require a complete reversal of US policy towards Iran.The statement says: “Though never intended to kill, US ‘maximum pressure’ through sanctions on Iran are compromising the performance of the Iranian healthcare system as Iran’s outbreak moves into its second month. Despite humanitarian exemptions provided under US and international law, these sanctions make the importation of medicine, medical equipment and raw materials needed to produce these goods domestically slower, more expensive, and complicated.”The US state department claims medical trade is not blocked by US sanctions, but the group of former leaders say they have identified a series of barriers that make medical trade near impossible. The steps they recommend include expanding the scope of humanitarian exemptions under US sanctions specifically to include devices and equipment necessary to effectively combat Covid-19, providing extra resources to the US treasury to process sanctions-waiver requests, and sending general US treasury comfort letters to European banks, shipping firms and insurers.The signatories urge Trump not to use America’s voting rights on the IMF board to disrupt an Iranian request for a $5bn(£4bn) IMF loan, and to issue a statement supporting the use of Instex, the mechanism created by the UK, France and Germany in 2019 to allow European companies to trade with Iran without exposing themselves to the consequences of US sanctions. Iran was not on the first IMF list of countries to be granted coronavirus-linked loans.The group warns of “significant and long-lasting consequences for the reputation of the United States and Europe among the Iranian people” if Trump does not provide relief. “This would starkly raise the political costs of engaging with either the US or Europe for any current or future Iranian decision-makers, while simultaneously boosting the influence of Iran’s non-western partners”.Trump has claimed Iran does privately want US aid, but the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, under pressure from hardliners, has denied this.On Monday, Abbas Mousavi, a foreign ministry spokesman, said Iran would never ask the US for help. “Iran has never asked and will not ask America to help Tehran in its fight against the outbreak ... but America should lift all its illegal, unilateral sanctions on Iran,” Mousavi said in a televised news conference.Iran’s own messaging on the need for external aid is also confused, with some leaders saying the country is self-sufficient, and others insisting there are dire shortages.Iran formally withdrew criticism of Chinese coronavirus statistics after the health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, had on Sunday described the Chinese figures as a joke in a tweet and at a press conference.Iran’s death toll stood at 3,739 on Monday, with more than 60,500 infected. There is no sign of any fall in the numbers being infected, as many Iranians return to work after the Iranian new year holiday. Concern remains within the Iranian government that too many Iranians are still ignoring social distancing guidelines."

The creditors are likely to be suppliers who have not been paid for stock they have provided.The retailer’s creditors will now be prevented from pursuing legal action for 10 working days while Debenhams tries to secure a new rescue deal.The retailer has been battling the effects of £600m of debt, tough competition and the downturn on the high street. It has closed 22 stores this year and plans to close a total of 50 outlets across the UK.Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the chief executive, said he was working with landlords and pension trustees and “striving to protect jobs and reopen as many Debenhams stores as we can, as soon as this is possible.”The majority of the group’s employees in the UK are being paid under the government’s furlough scheme after its order for all non-essential stores to close. The retailer has also written to its landlords asking for a five-month rent holidayDebenhams is continuing to trade online across the UK, Ireland and Denmark, and customer orders, gift cards and returns are being accepted and processed normally.Julie Palmer, a partner at the insolvency firm Begbies Traynor, said: “Debenhams has been in financial difficulties for a while so this doesn’t come as a major surprise, but it will leave its 20,000-plus strong workforce in a precarious position during the ongoing uncertainty.”Debenhams is one of many retailers in financial difficulties because of the coronavirus shutdown.Since the measures began, several other chains including New Look and the Topshop owner, Arcadia, have declined to pay their rent and furloughed their staff. Two of Britain’s largest shopping centre owners, Intu Properties and Hammerson, reported that they had received about only a third of rent due from their tenants for the second quarter of the year on its due date at the end of March.An extended period of store closures has left an estimated £10bn of clothing piling up in warehouses."

No, of course you can’t. But this isn’t pornography. It’s erotica.Pardon? Dirty novels.Oh. You’ll hear all about it soon. Several enterprising authors have already rushed out their own sexy ebooks, specifically about situations surrounding the lockdown. If you have a Kindle or Kindle app, you can read them today.What sort of books are we talking about? Well, there is Covid-69: An Erotic Coronavirus Quarantine Story by J Andrews. And Sex During the Coronavirus Pandemic (tagline: “They could lock down her country, but never her heart”). And FFM Lockdown. And The Physical Manifestation of Washing My Hands Gets Me Off, in which a woman begins a lesbian affair with the physical manifestation of the concept of hand-washing.Please stop. There is also Quaranteen: Step-Sibling Love in the Time of the Coronavirus; and Love in Lockdown, in which the main character says: “Death has his tongue in your mouth, his long fingers around your breasts.”Done? For now. There will be hundreds more of them in a week, though.But why? Oh, loads of reasons. You can’t write traditional erotica now because it wouldn’t ring true. There are no chance encounters any more. The plumber doesn’t come to visit. Your personal trainer has to stay two metres from you. Your babysitter has been declared nonessential. Your child’s teacher now gives you feedback solely through Google Classroom. Erotica has to adapt, or it will die.Why else? People are bored and horny. That’s it.Why has this only happened with sexy books? In truth, it hasn’t. Since going into lockdown, Amazon has been flooded with coronavirus-related ebooks. There are self-help quarantine dating books, children’s stories, investment guides, workout manuals, parenting books.But mainly erotica. Yes. And religious books, weirdly. Once you get bored with getting yourself off, why not read something like Christ Is King, Not Coronavirus: A Christian Response to Our Current Pandemic?Can’t I just read normal books that aren’t about the outbreak? Sure, you could, but that would be missing the point.And what point is that? That we are living through a moment in history. These books are historical artefacts. A century from now, our descendants will look back at 2020 with puzzlement. The existence of stories such as FFM Lockdown and Quaranteen will show them how we coped.Do say: “Shakespeare wrote King Lear under quarantine.”Don’t say: “And today I finished writing my novella Blowvid-19, so I’m practically a bard.”"

He still has a cough and a temperature, more than 11 days after first reporting symptoms.No 10 insisted it had been “transparent throughout” Johnson’s illness, despite having described the prime minister’s symptoms as mild right up until his hospital admission. Johnson himself only admitted to still having a temperature, not a cough, in his video message on Friday morning. No 10 has now changed its description of his symptoms to “persistent”.Two Tory ministers – Nadine Dorries and James Duddridge – have suggested Johnson needs to rest.However, No 10 said he was taking advice from his doctors on whether it was safe for him to continue working and was still in touch with No 10 officials from his hospital bed. Earlier, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, insisted Johnson was fit enough to lead the country from his hospital bed after he was admitted with persistent coronavirus symptoms.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.Johnson was admitted on Sunday evening with a high fever on the advice of his doctor, with Downing Street saying he was undergoing routine tests. He was kept in overnight.Most coronavirus patients stay in hospital for more than a week. However, Jenrick told BBC Breakfast: “We all hope and expect that he can get back to No 10 very soon.”If his condition worsens, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is the designated minister to take charge. Raab chaired a Monday morning meeting of the government’s C-19 committee, which is leading the response to the pandemic. However, Tuesday’s cabinet meeting has been cancelled.The pound fell against the dollar and euro overnight on Monday as foreign exchange markets took fright at the possibility of Johnson being out of action. The prime minister had been hoping to leave quarantine on Friday but his persistent temperature meant he had to remain inside his flat at No 11 Downing Street.The Guardian was told last week that Johnson was more seriously ill than either he or his officials were prepared to admit, and that he was being seen by doctors who were concerned about his breathing.But Downing Street flatly denied the prime minister’s health had seriously deteriorated, and insisted there were no plans at that point for him to be admitted to hospital.Asked if it was time for colleagues in the cabinet and civil service to tell Johnson to rest, Jenrick told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “He has worked phenomenally hard, as have many people across the country. This has been a uniquely intense period and I know for him personally it will be very frustrating that he has had to go to hospital to have these tests.“He will want to be back in No 10 leading from the front, which is his way. But he remains in charge of the government; he will be updated regularly in hospital, as he has been as he’s self-isolating.” On Sunday, Matt Hancock was asked just how ill the prime minister was. The health secretary told Sophy Ridge on Sky News: “He’s OK. I’ve been talking to him every day, several times a day … he’s very much got his hand on the tiller. But he’s still got a temperature.”Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, revealed on Saturday that she had also contracted the virus but was recovering.While No 10 did not say what tests Johnson would have in hospital, experts said they would be likely to focus on assessing how the prime minister’s lungs, heart and other organs were responding to the virus.“Doctors will be monitoring important vital signs such as oxygen saturations,” said Dr Rupert Beale, who heads the cell biology of infection laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London.“They will also check blood tests to see what the immune response to the virus looks like, and to assess liver and kidney function. They will perform an electrocardiogram to check the heart. More sophisticated tests may include a CT scan of the chest to get an accurate picture of the lungs.”With Johnson in hospital, the ministers involved in the government’s coronavirus response will be looking ahead to next weekend, which is the point at which it will have to extend or end the lockdown.Jenrick signalled the lockdown was unlikely to be lifted at the end of the week, saying some of the most challenging weeks were probably still to come. As communities secretary, he said the government “desperately” did not want to shut parks but it could happen if people continued to congregate for picnics.Critics of the government are concerned that ministers have not identified a way out of the lockdown, with doubts about its ability to scale up testing for live cases and the efficacy of new antibody tests to find out whether people have had the virus.The former prime minister Tony Blair called for a senior minister to “take charge of testing, and nothing else, with people with business experience of how you ramp up industrial scale production”.He said it was not the right choice for an epidemiologist to be in charge of this effort, after the government put Prof John Newton of Public Health England in charge.“Unless you are able to get mass testing at scale, with speed, I don’t see how you can get a way out of this lockdown and I am terrified by the economic damage we are doing with every week this lockdown continues,” Blair told the Today programme.“This damage is enormous … If it goes on for a long time then it doesn’t just affect the economy per se, it also affects the ability to operate your healthcare service effectively.”His comments echo the calls of the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has for more than a week advocated a return to mass community testing to suppress virus hotspots where they arise."
"156","https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-bergamo-work-ethic-lockdown","2020-04-06T08:19:13-0400","This is Europe  Devastated by coronavirus, did Bergamo's work ethic count against it? ","Lombardy is one of the richest and most productive regions in Italy and Bergamo is its beating heart. It is also my home town: the city where I spent my childhood and adolescence. The province’s million inhabitants are characterised by a strong sense of belonging: to region and to family. They take pride too in a no-nonsense, practical approach to life and a powerful work ethic.Today, Bergamo holds the European record that no town wants: it is the place where the coronavirus pandemic has cast its darkest shadow. Bergamo is a lazaretto of pain, where the priority of hospital managers is to select only the patients they think will survive. Its undertakers are so overwhelmed they have to ask neighbouring communes to take their corpses for cremation.Italy’s death toll from this pandemic passed 15,000 on 4 April, although the number of actual deaths is probably higher. Bergamo, the most infected province in Italy, has had 9,712 confirmed cases and 2,245 deaths according to the official data. An investigation by the Eco di Bergamo newspaper estimates that in Bergamo province alone the virus killed 4,500 people in March.The rate of loss of life feels out of control to local people and defies all understanding. Forced confinement, physical distancing and care for the weakest seem futile. The virus seemed to defeat any effort, annihilate any commitment. Here, no one took to singing on balconies, to giving concerts online: the place is in perpetual mourning.But was the initial reluctance to shut down Bergamo’s factories and thriving economy a factor in spreading the infection?To grasp that first reaction it helps to understand just how efficient and solid the economic and industrial fabric here has been for generations. The province has Italy’s biggest concentration of the country’s best-performing small and medium-sized enterprises, clustered mostly in the lower Bergamo region. But it is also home to big international companies such as Brembo, which makes automotive braking systems, and Kiko, the international cosmetics brand founded by Antonio Percassi, also president of the local football team, Atalanta. Some Bergamo success stories such as the drinks company San Pellegrino, now owned by Nestlé, have been absorbed by multinationals.The three Alpine valleys of the province have more farms than businesses. The small towns that make up these valleys have strong rural communities that maintain their traditions at parish level, but can feel closed in on themselves. Everyone knows everyone else, many elderly people still speak the dialect, and even teenagers stick close to home.The city of Bergamo by contrast could hardly be more open: it is directly linked to the main European capitals by Orio al Serio airport (also known as Milan/Bergamo), which is a hub for Ryanair and had nearly 14 million passengers in 2019. These frequent connections are an important source of tourism for the city. In 1913, the German-Swiss writer and intellectual Hermann Hesse visited Bergamo and observed: “I was greeted by a modern railway station and a modern city … the evening stroll was crowded and the tramway crowded.” Then he took the funicular to reach the upper town, the historical part of the city surrounded by Venetian walls, “below me, the nightlife of the city was off … here I was in the middle of an ancient and dark city, swallowed up by a narrow and deserted alleyway, just as the shops were closing … it suddenly seemed to me that I was in southern Tuscany”.Hesse immediately grasped the duality of Bergamo: modern and ancient, economically open to the world but closed in on its traditions. On the one hand, a strong social and cultural life linked by voluntary work through the Catholic church. On the other, a remarkable focus on productivity, work, the family and above all the family business.It is clear looking back that this rich and dynamic city struggled to come to a halt when the virus arrived. For the Bergamaschi, work and self-reliance have always been fundamental values. But faced with a health emergency, was a strong business ethic a tragic disadvantage?By 23 February, the virus had already infected Val Seriana, the Bergamo valley where two villages, Alzano Lombardo and Nembro, quickly became the ground zero of the epidemic in the region.Four days earlier, on 19 February, an Atalanta-Valencia Champions League football match was attended by 45,000 fans in Milan, an event widely blamed for having accelerated the spread across the region.The contagion reached Codogno (a small town in Lodi province, 65km from Bergamo) two days after the game, and Codogno was immediately made a “red zone”, in other words quarantined with police checkpoints guarding entry and exit. By contrast, in Bergamo schools closed, but there was resistance to any sweeping stay-at-home measures until 8 March when all of Lombardy went into full lockdown.The Italian government had declared a nationwide health emergency on 31 January but Stefano Scaglia, the president of Confindustria Bergamo, which represents 1,200 businesses employing 80,000 people, offered reassurance. On 29 February, the organisation published a message in English aimed at the region’s international export partners, accompanied by the hashtag “#Bergamoisrunning”. Drawing on the Italian government’s advice it said “the risk of infection is low” and warned against “a distorted perception” created by the media. Confindustria could guarantee that “the government and responsible agencies have taken immediate protective measures to prevent further cases”. Scaglia’s message to global business: work goes on, we remain open.I was still in Bergamo when the body which represents local shops posted a promotional video accompanied by the hashtag #bergamononsiferma. A song by a local band accompanying images of Bergamo people peacefully ambling through the heart of the city seemed a bit too cheerful. The message was “let’s live without fear, let’s keep drinking coffee at the bar”. Bergamo’s mayor, Giorgio Gori, had earlier sent out optimistic messages, stressing that whatever strain the virus was putting on tourism, catering and commerce, the city would quickly put this “nightmare” behind it. Everyone’s desire was to continue working and consuming in spite of everything.Within weeks, army vehicles would be transporting corpses to other cities and hospital doctors were warning that the situation in Bergamo was “catastrophic” and out of control. Now in the mourning city and province, many people in Bergamo have abandoned their former quiet pragmatism.In the absence of work and the rational, efficient world they knew, blind anger is creeping in at what they see as official negligence. The most important failing, they believe, was not to impose a lockdown sooner, to shut the factories and businesses and keep people in their homes.I can see attitudes hardening too: people are looking for explanations and some are spreading baseless theories. In the many WhatsApp groups in which people share information and encouragement, conspiracy theories are cropping up more and more. “Why are so few immigrants getting sick?” “The Chinese grew the virus in a laboratory to weaken us!”In 2019 Bergamo had the second lowest unemployment rate in Italy. Now a major economic crisis, especially in the industrial and tourism sectors, seems inevitable.It’s not hard to see the far right taking advantage of the dark mood. Bergamo city is governed by the centre-left Democratic party. The province though is a stronghold for Matteo Salvini’s Lega.And people are looking for someone to blame. Facebook messages rant about Europe and “selfish” Germany. “Get out of the EU, get rid of the euro, reset the government and drive out immigrants,” reads one post. Another asks: “Germany is stealing our masks, France is spitting on us, what kind of shitty Europe is this?”Some will see this as a region lashing out and falling for populist slogans. I see my city distraught and destroyed by grief: people drawing on their last reserves of mental strength to make sense of the unimaginable. But I also see signs of hope in their resilience and solidarity: last week, volunteers, Alpini (elite Italian army troops), craftsmen and Atalanta fans completed work on a new field hospital in 10 days.As they worked they chanted: “People like us never give up.”• Anna Bonalume is a freelance journalist"

We were promised that innately British pluck, the kind that had housewives chatting among the remains of their bombed-out houses as the Queen stopped by to give them tea, would get Britain through this plague. It was supposed to get us through the ravages of Brexit. (Remember that? Hilarious!) Yet the global plague superseded that, which is a bit like being mid-shark attack, only for you and the shark to be swallowed suddenly by a T rex.Anyway – the blitz! Even the Queen referenced the second world war in her Sunday night address to the nation, because of course she did. Alas, it turns out this famous blitz spirit may have been as much of a myth as the benefits of Brexit, with some of the most famous photos from the blitz, such as the milkman doing his rounds through ruined houses, having long been exposed as fakes.As for the reports of wartime British solidarity, these too have been greatly exaggerated. For example, there were reports of middle-class families in the countryside worrying that housing evacuated working-class children would result in “the spoliation of decent homes and furniture [or] the corruption of speech or moral standards of our own children”. Yay, blitz spirit!Which brings us to Britain today. How is that famed blitz spirit holding up? Well, it seemed to me that, for the first week after the sort-of-kind-of-lockdown began, it was doing OK. Putting to one side the fear of death and the death of loved ones, there was a kind of national fascination that we were all going through such a collective event. Sporting successes are few and far between, so there was a novelty in all of us knowing where almost every person in the country was (in their sitting room) and that we were all experiencing the same emotions (anxiety to boredom and back again). And then, after a week, maybe even 10 days, things turned.The signs were always there, with the early bursts of frantic stockpiling and – perhaps more telling, in retrospect – the furious tutting over said stockpiling. Because it seems to me – from my admittedly limited vantage point of reading the internet, Zooming with friends and daily 15-minute outings with the dog – that what was once a collective experience has now broken down into factions, each one snarling at the other.There are those who insist that people need to stop going to the park and that a walk round the block should suffice for even the most hyperactive toddler. Then there are those who wonder how the other people have gone through life without ever meeting a toddler. There are the solo isolaters, bored and lonely. There are the stressed home-schooling parents, who would rip out their own hair for empty hours of solitude. There are the people with gardens who don’t understand why so many people insist on going for walks. There are the people without gardens who desperately need some vitamin D. There are the people who fearfully run off to their second homes versus those who think these people are immoral and selfish; the achievers who believe now is the time for them to write their King Lear versus the sloths who think the achievers are show-offs who should chill and watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine; and, of course, walkers versus joggers, which is the new cyclists versus drivers.On top of everyone looking at others and thinking they all have it easier, as if they are somehow cheating physical distancing, there is the general collective tutting. The daily tutting photos on social media of crowded parks, taken by people who don’t understand that they are, in fact, part of the crowd. As a Dutch advert put it in 2010: “You are not in traffic. You are traffic.” Every time I hear shouts of laughter in the street outside my house, I see my neighbours rush to the window, determined to tut at some wrongdoers – and I see my neighbours doing this because I am doing it, too.We are not living through the blitz, but we are fighting something unseeable and completely terrifying. So, in the absence of a concrete enemy, we vent our anger and anxiety on one another. It is understandable, even if it is not very nice. No matter what anyone says, this experience is not the same for all of us: some of us live in houses, some in flats, some are drowning in toddlers, some are not. But we are all pretty scared. So, even if the material details between us remain as unequal and unfair as ever, on an emotional level, this is a helluva leveller. And that is something to remember."

The sudden shortages, the constant meal planning, the rationing of fresh ingredients and the eking out of every last scrap ...There’s no doubt that these are good habits to get into, and that this period has the potential to make better cooks of us all. We might become more conscious about food waste, realise we don’t need to eat meat as much as we thought we did, grow more creative with the ingredients we have available.Below are 10 recipes from my archive that I’m revisiting most at the moment: nourishing, hearty family meals that give us the goodness we need as resourcefully as possible. If, like me, you suddenly find yourself at home with children, some of these make an excellent diversion for little hands and big appetites.Apples, carrot, nuts, raisins, herbs, and the eponymous rice, a dish that’s packed with both flavour and nutrition, making it a brilliant lunchtime filler for all the family. If you don’t have the wild rice I suggest in the recipe, use whatever you have, such as basmati.Comforting, utterly delicious and cheap as chips! My children were fascinated by how to make baked beans from scratch and to see how the various ingredients add different levels of flavour. Leave out the meat for a veggie version, and the eggs and sour cream for vegans.This macaroni cheese is a great way to make a bit of cheese go a long way and is spiked with broccoli, giving the whole family all the nutrition it needs to stay happy and well.If you are finding eggs hard to find in the shops try making this silky, indulgent and incredibly delicious Catalan-inspried allioli, using apples to bind the mayonnaise instead of the normal egg. Layer it over sliced parsnips with hints of garlic and toasted nuts for a magical, warming gratin.Sweet soft wedges of red onions cooked in butter and balsamic vinegar popped into pastry with blue cheese, thyme and black pepper.The rich, warming spices so loved in Mexico add delicious layers of flavour to this fun, family dish. The sweet onions, tomatoes and pulses make the small amount of meat go a long way adding extra bang for your buck in terms of key protein.The tomato sauce can be made in minutes with tins from the cupboard, leaving you to focus on making the dumplings. Experiment with different greens and get young people involved.The glorious flavours and textures at play here – buttery, crispy pastry filled with salty feta and sweet spinach – belie the simplicity of the recipe. It makes a killer of a lunch or dinner with remarkably little fuss.A brilliantly cheap but tasty supper. Serve with rice or bread or with some sausages on the side.These roasted roots are infinitely adaptable – swap vegetables in and out, try feta if you haven’t got goat’s cheese, and, while saba is hard to get hold of at the moment, I suggest reducing some balsamic vinegar to a syrupy glaze in its place."

Jenrick said he had heard Johnson is “doing well” and hopes he will be back in Downing Street soon. Asked if the PM will spend more nights in hospital, Jenrick said: “He will obviously take the advice of doctors and nurses who are doing those tests and act accordingly.” He insisted Johnson remains in day-to-day charge of the government.Meanwhile, Japan’s government is poised to declare a state of emergency on Tuesday after a surge in coronavirus cases in Tokyo. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is also expected to announce an “unprecedented” 108 trillion yen ($989bn) package in response to the “biggest crisis” the global economy has faced since the second world war, a draft document has revealed.In airline news, British Airways announced it would be suspending direct flights between Japan and the UK, and American Airlines Group Inc said late Sunday it would suspend more flights in and out of New York City’s three main airports for about a month.Indonesia recorded its biggest daily jump in cases, with 218 confirmed on Monday, and the Philippines recorded 414 new infections.

Sixth formers have lost the chance to improve their grades through last-minute revision, and university students have been left hanging, unable to sit their final exams, say goodbye to friends, or invite their families to graduation ceremonies. Students from different stages in their education tell how their plans for the future are being shaped by the crisis.A-level student, Leicester High School for Girls“Everyone was scared on the last few days of sixth form, with lots of people self-isolating. We were told on Wednesday that we had two days to say goodbye; it felt rushed. We don’t know what’s going to happen next or when we’ll see each other.I was going to put everything into my revision around Easter. In January when you’ve got mocks your priority isn’t revision, and then there’s other deadlines to meet – coursework, personal statements, Ucas applications. Teacher attainment grades don’t take that into consideration.Now I’ve lost the motivation to continue revising as I have lost sight of what I will be working towards. The conflicting information from teachers, who are also uncertain, has left us students confused. I fear that all schools will not be held to the same regulations, with some recommending students do essays as evidence of their grade. This system could disadvantage students with a poor relationship with their teacher and BAME students, who tend to exceed their predicted grades. I would prefer exams to be postponed. Because there have been a lot of articles about the cap on university places, everyone was worried about theirs being taken away. My application didn’t need to be firmed until 4 May, but I didn’t want my place getting taken away so I firmed out of fear. Although I do think I made the right decision, I feel I should have taken more time to make it.”First-year journalism student, Ulster University“Because of the staff strikes and now the coronavirus outbreak, I’ve only had four physical classes in my first year. The rest have been online. It feels like we’re being left high and dry with very little support. We’ve had very few contact hours. Ideally I’d like a reduced fee next year, or a bit of money back.However we have technically still been ‘taught’ throughout the outbreak. And obviously with the strikes, reducing our fees is only going to reduce money available to the staff who were on strike for better pay, so that doesn’t really sound fair.The online teaching has been OK. But I haven’t had video classes, which most of the other courses do – they’ve just put up PowerPoints and lecture notes for us that we’ve had to read through. So you have less of the explanation, and it’s a lot more effort if you’re having issues with something. You’ve got to email your lecturer and then wait for a response, whereas in an actual lecture you’d have a response instantly. We were also learning to use Adobe software, but the university won’t shell out for all of us to download it, so that’s a few months of useful learning down the drain.”Acting student, Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts“We’re in a limbo. We were in the middle of our final shows, halfway through rehearsals, then everything got cancelled. The school’s doing its best to keep the teaching online, but with acting it’s difficult to practise your craft without being in a room with other actors and the director. At the moment our shows are postponed indefinitely and we’re just waiting for information. Either they’ll postpone and we’ll go back into rehearsals later, or they’ll cancel them and replace it with some kind of written assessment, which would be a shame.It would be a difficult time anyway, that first year out of university. Our third year was meant to be about getting us out into the industry: getting agents and meetings with casting directors. It’s about launching the first year of your acting career. But nothing’s happening in the industry – shows have been cancelled, and casting directors aren’t meeting with people. The casting directors don’t have any work either. Some of them are doing callouts for show reels online to support acting grads.In your third year, you’re also saying goodbye to a lot of people you might never see again. My flatmate is from Iceland, and he suddenly had to go home. There’s this sense of ‘is that it? Is that the last time I see you for the next few years?’ It’s a weird time.”Final-year philosophy student, University of Reading“I’m a bit fed up. I’ve spent three years working hard to maintain a good grade and now, with the anxiety of everything going on, it’s hard to get anything done. I have a chronic disability, which means I struggle with going to lectures and other things. It’s funny how they’ve now put lectures online, which they wouldn’t normally do for disabled students like me. But they can suddenly do it now everyone’s impacted.My graduation has been postponed. A lot of people might not be able to attend theirs now. It feels like we’ve worked so hard for this big moment, and it’s been taken away. Obviously you can’t predict a global pandemic, but it’s tough.The university has offered deadline extensions and exam retakes, but it doesn’t really work for final-year students. A lot of us will be starting jobs, internships or master’s programmes. We’ve asked for a ‘no detriment’ policy because we have no access to materials in the library. This would mean any work we hand in now doesn’t negatively affect our overall grades if it’s below standard. But the university said no. I’ve still got 45% of my final-year assessments to submit. It’s very tough.”Final year PhD student, University of Cambridge“The archives and libraries that I depend on were understandably shut with very little notice so I grabbed what books I could. I don’t have all the resources I need to keep working so I’m tinkering at the edges of my thesis. So many of the ‘lightbulb’ moments that have occurred over my studies have been instigated by conversations with other students or fellows with completely different research interests. I’m feeling very anxious. These are not conducive circumstances for work at the moment, with the amount of worry I’m feeling for my family.I got engaged on 16 March, a few hours before Boris Johnson’s press conference discouraging non-essential contact. We haven’t been able to see any of our friends to celebrate. But we’re thrilled, and wedding planning has given us something other than work to think about while we’re cooped up in our college accommodation.Like a lot of postgraduate students I do part-time work to supplement my income. I had a zero-hours contract, the flexibility of which really suited me, but now that’s dried up I’m £50 per week worse off.I have friends working on historical epidemics and plagues who are tweaking their research grant applications to highlight the sudden, painful relevance of their topics. I study sieges in seventeenth-century Britain and Ireland. Accounts which emphasise the claustrophobic intimacy of besiegement and the fear of diseases which swept through enclosed spaces, strike me a lot more now.”"
"165","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-us-medical-students-pandemic","2020-04-06T07:00:00-0400","  As some US medical students heed call to action, others are sidelined amid pandemic ","Muhammad Sarib Hussain is among a burgeoning number of advanced medical students who have been asked to enlist in the US “war” against the coronavirus outbreak.Already, a number of schools around the United States have decided to offer their graduating students early diplomas as state officials plead for reinforcements for staff in overburdened and beleaguered hospital systems.Hussain, a member of Harvard Medical School’s class of 2020, is one of the graduating students who will have the option to quickly deploy into Massachusetts hospitals. He is currently in Pakistan with his family ahead of Ramadan, but he’s leaning toward coming back to the US.“This was what we signed up for, right?” Hussain said. “If there’s a fire out there, firefighters can’t sort of count themselves out.”He’s not alone in his sense of duty right now, but he is among the few who have been given a path to action. There’s a much larger army of medical students in the US impatiently awaiting their marching orders even as some of their schools bench them during the greatest fight of their young lives.“I just feel like I’m being sidelined at a time when the world needs help medically the most, and it’s frustrating for me,” said Haley Shumway, who attends the Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine.Coronavirus has completely upended medical students’ lives as learning goes virtual, schools restrict direct patient care to varying degrees and graduation ceremonies lose their pomp and circumstance. A student population accustomed to planning years in advance is being told to sit tight even as their country is in dire need of the skill sets and specialties they’ve been developing for years.“I feel like I’m in this limbo place, where I have training to help, but I’m also being told to stay at home,” said Kelly McDermott, who graduates from Eastern Virginia Medical School this year.Adam Eddington, a student at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine, was working in pediatrics when he was pulled from patient care by his school. Even though Covid-19 hasn’t affected children as much as other demographics, Eddington gets that it wouldn’t be fair for him to progress normally in his training while so many of his peers can’t. Still, he wrestled with his school’s choice for a bit.“I think all in all it was the right decision,” he said. “As far as I know, it’s unprecedented, and it’s gonna take a lot of work to make sure that we adapt and move forward to try to get all the experience and get all the qualifications that are necessary to make us really good physicians. But I have faith in the systems in place to try to do that.”A lot of students learned that they’d be temporarily removed from direct patient care a few weeks ago, around the same time that the Association of American Medical Colleges issued guidance on the subject.Alison Whelan, chief medical education officer for the AAMC, said her organization encouraged members to suspend clinical experiences because of personal protective equipment shortages, a lack of widely available, rapid testing and the need to limit contact between people as much as possible. She and her colleagues have since reiterated their guidance, unless there’s a critical local need for health care workers.“A lot of us understand that we aren’t the most essential as medical students, ’cause we’re learning. But at the same time, a lot of us wanted to be involved and wanted to learn how to handle situations like this in the future,” said Sara Grant, a student at the Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine.The suggestion doesn’t mean students have to stop learning, Whelan said, or even that their rotations have to end. In practice, it’s been handled in different ways, depending on the school.At Oakland, Grant said she and her classmates were participating in virtual lectures, working through interactive cases and physical exam videos, and doing other supplements to try to troubleshoot for what they were missing in-person. Similarly, Dartmouth moved almost entirely online, and Eddington said students like him suddenly had access to a series of non-clinical electives as well as swiftly organized Covid-19 ethics and microbiology courses.Shumway wasn’t given guidance from Rocky Vista for a week and a half, beyond studying for exams. But eventually, the school sent an email asking students to fill support roles in and outside the hospital – everything from comforting overflow patients to triaging over the phone.At the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, students weren’t categorically removed from patient care, except for known or suspected Covid-19 cases.John Davis, associate dean for curriculum at the school, called it an “educational imperative” to give especially his most advanced learners the opportunity to watch people who are responding to the crisis in real time before they in turn assume some of those responsibilities.“Ultimately, I do think that the students who are graduating now will graduate with additional skills and competencies that other cohorts might not have had, which is being able to respond to a pandemic,” Davis said.Students who have had their clinical experiences put on pause aren’t just twiddling their thumbs. Even before Shumway got more detailed direction from her school, she was scrounging up ways to use her medical knowledge outside of a patient care environment. After hearing a lot of dangerous rumors and pseudoscience circulating around the coronavirus pandemic, she decided to make a podcast that set the record straight.Vitamin C and essential oils can’t cure Covid-19, she explained. Saunas and hot baths won’t prevent infection, either. And swishing vinegar doesn’t do much of anything to fight the disease, despite a meme her friend posted on Facebook claiming otherwise.“I’m not comparing the common cold to this virus, but the common cold is also a virus. And has your mother ever asked you to go swallow some vinegar to get rid of your cold? No,” she said.Other students are babysitting for physicians, donating blood, volunteering at food drives, rounding up personal protective equipment from local businesses, or even just providing accurate information to their networks as panic and fake news around the pandemic spreads.“Those things are meaningful now, and they need to believe that,” Whelan said.Meanwhile, some are already readying themselves for the next time their country calls.“Life is really, really short, and it should be spent wearing yourself out, trying to help people,” Eddington said. “And if that means that I get worn out trying to help people in the next pandemic, then that would be fine.”"
"166","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/06/millions-us-at-risk-losing-running-water-amid-layoffs-triggered-coronavirus-pandemic","2020-04-06T07:00:00-0400","Our unequal earth  Millions in US at risk of 'water shutoffs' amid layoffs triggered by pandemic ","Millions of Americans risk losing running water if they fall behind with bill payments in coming months, as mass layoffs triggered by the coronavirus pandemic force families to make impossible tradeoffs on paying household expenses.Around two-fifths of the country rely on water utilities which have not suspended the policy of shutoffs for non-payment, despite public health warnings that good hygiene – specifically frequent hand washing – is crucial to preventing spread of the highly contagious virus, according to data analysed by Food and Water Watch (FWW) and the Guardian.The virus has spread exponentially in the past month with 336,912 confirmed cases in the US as of Sunday, including 9,615 deaths, according to data collated by the New York Times. An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Americans are expected to die from Covid-19 complications, even if mitigation measures like good hygiene and social distancing are fully implemented.“This is an emergency and the priority is to stop the spread so this is a no brainer, everyone must have access to water… this should not be a partisan issue,” said congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, who is pushing federal intervention.In addition to the public health toll, the economic impact of the pandemic is already devastating families, with close to 10 millon people filing for unemployment benefits during the second half of March and an unprecedented spike in demand for emergency aid at food banks. One in two American adults have either no emergency savings or not enough to cover three months of living expenses, according to Bankrate’s 2019 Financial Security Index.Yet despite the evolving economic and health crises, less than 60% of the population have so far been protected from water shutoffs. And just 11% of these utilities have explicitly pledged to reconnect households currently without running water due to unpaid bills.“As unemployment reaches record highs, millions of Americans are going to have to choose between paying for food, rent and bills… water is not something people should have to tradeoff,” said Mary Grant, director of water at FWW.There is no national database tracking shutoffs or the number of US households left without running water. But in 2016, one in every 20 households were disconnected by public water departments, leaving an estimated 15 million Americans without running water.The highest shutoffs rates were concentrated in southern and rural states including Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida and Oklahoma. Some of the hardest-hit towns and cities including New Orleans, Detroit, Milwaukee, Mecklenburg, Ada and Dekalb are now Covid-19 hot-spots, according to analysis by the Guardian.In New Orleans, which has the fourth highest rate of coronavirus infection per capita in the country, only 300 households have so far been reconnected and the city does not know how many remain without running water.“It’s a package of related factors – institutional racism, environmental injustice, and poverty – which means communities most vulnerable to Covid-19 are the same communities most vulnerable to water shutoffs,” said Grant.So far, the moratoriums on shutoffs include 12 statewide orders, which apply to private and public water providers, issued by the governors of California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin.On Monday a coalition of community groups were set to call on New York governor Andrew Cuomo to issue a moratorium on price hikes, fines and shutoffs until 180 days after the end of the state of emergency.Currently, 8.5 million stateside New Yorkers still face the threat of disconnection if they fail to keep up with bills, while the number of households without running water is unknown. Shutoffs have been banned in New York City since before the pandemic, but in Buffalo for example, taps were turned off on 17,000 occasions between 2015 and March 2019. Buffalo has suspended shutoffs but is not reconnecting those without running water.Meanwhile, there are signs of some political will to tackle the issue in Washington.The House version of the third rescue package included $1.5bn to assist low income households with water bills during the crisis, and a condition which required localities and utilities to suspend utility shutoffs in order to qualify for financial aid.But the clauses were left out of the final bill approved by the senate on 26 March.Instead, congressional Democrats want $12bn for water subsidies in the fourth rescue package, with grants for utilities conditional on shutoff moratoriums. The National Association of Clean Water Agencies expects the pandemic to cost $12.5bn in lost revenue due to unpaid bills, debt forgiveness and restoring service.Last week, House speaker Nancy Pelosi signalled plans to propose $85bn for water projects in a subsequent forthcoming infrastructure bill to stimulate economic recovery.Almost 28 million people could lose their jobs by May, according to forecasting firm Oxford Economics – more than double the jobs cut during the 2007 to 2009 recession and its aftermath.Congresswoman Lawrence said: “Access to water has not been a priority in this country because it’s been a poor person’s issue ... now it’s a national concern and we have to transform our mindset.”"

What is Covid-19 and what are the symptoms?Covid-19 is the illness caused by a novel member of the coronavirus family that has transferred from animals to humans. The most common symptoms are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell.About 80% of people experience a mild case and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people become seriously ill.How do I know if I have coronavirus and what happens next?How do I protect myself and others from the coronavirus?Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds each time, and use hand sanitiser gel. Catch coughs and sneezes with a disposable tissue and bin the tissue. If you don’t have a tissue available, cough and sneeze into the crook of your arm. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.How should I self-isolate if I am showing symptoms?Different countries have set different rules, but broadly speaking, if you live alone and develop a new continuous cough or a high temperature it is recommended to stay at home for seven days after symptoms began. If you live with others, everyone in the house must stay at home and not leave for 14 days. Studies show that people have the coronavirus without symptoms for five days on average.The infection may spread from person to person in shared houses. If anyone else starts to show symptoms while already in isolation, they must stay at home for seven days from the moment their own symptoms start, regardless of where they are in the 14-day isolation period. Check with your local medical authorities for specific advice that may be applied in your area.What is social and physical distancing?Many authorities are asking people to practise social and physical distancing. To reduce the spread of the virus, you should avoid meeting up with friends and family who don’t live with you. If you need to see the doctor or other essential services, use the phone, internet or social media if possible. In some places, you can go out for a walk for exercise and to buy essentials, but stay two metres apart from others. Check with local authorities for specific rules that may be applied in your area.How do I care for someone suffering from Covid-19?Keep the patient rested and comfortable in loose-fitting clothing, keep the room where they are well ventilated, and ensure they drink plenty of water. Over-the counter pain relief may be helpful – but paracetamol (Tylenol) is recommended rather than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen (Advil).To prevent the coronavirus spreading within the household, if possible keep the patient in their own separate room and using a separate bathroom. They should have separate cutlery, crockery, bedding and towels, and preferably wear a mask. Regularly clean and disinfect high-frequency touch surfaces in the home such as door handles, toilets, kitchen counters and tabletops. Everybody in the house should be washing their hands frequently. Why are some people at greater risk from coronavirus?People with diabetes or heart disease are known to be at greater risk from coronavirus. The over-70s and pregnant women are also considered to be at higher risk. Men also seem more likely to die than women.Find out more: Why are some people are at greater risk from coronavirus?Where has the coronavirus spread?The coronavirus has spread to more than 150 countries. See the global map of confirmed cases or how many confirmed cases there are in your area in the UK or a map of the latest cases state by state in the US.How many people have been affected globally?What are countries doing to halt the spread of the coronavirus?Many countries have imposed travel bans, closed schools and introduced curfews and lockdown conditions to try to halt the spread of the disease.In the UK there is a set of lockdown conditions to limit the movement of people. Schools are closed except to the children of a defined government list of key workers. All non-essential travel is discouraged, and there are a list of government travel warnings about visiting the rest of the world.Coronavirus lockdown in the UK: the dos and don’tsCould I already have had this coronavirus?There is no test to tell. Scientists are developing antibody tests to check for a prior infection, but those aren’t ready for clinical use. The only definitive way to know that you’ve had it is to test positive for it while you have it.Find out more: Have I already had the coronavirus?Can a mask protect me?To some extent, yes, but not completely. Masks are effective at capturing droplets, a main transmission route of coronavirus. If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. However, masks will probably make little difference if you’re just walking around town, and are no guarantee of protection. Medical staff working with Covid-19 patients have been catching the virus despite all the protective equipment they have at their disposal.How long does coronavirus live on different surfaces?The New England Journal of Medicine published a study that tested how long the virus can remain stable on different kinds of surfaces within a controlled laboratory setting. They found that it was still detectable on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours. But it’s important to note that the amount of virus decreased rapidly over time on each of those surfaces. And so the risk of infection from touching them would probably decrease over time as well.Find out more: How long does coronavirus live on different surfaces?What do we know about Covid-19 and children?Reassuringly for parents, the disease has generally been milder in children, though they can spread it without displaying any symptoms. There are many unknowns, and research is continuing.Find out more: What we know so far about kids and the coronavirusHow do I explain the coronavirus to my children?With many children around the world suddenly taken out of school, it can be a worrying and bewildering time for them.Find out more from experts: How to talk to your children about the coronavirusHow does the coronavirus attack the human body?The coronavirus is a strip of ribonucleic acid inside a spherical protein capsule that is covered in spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell’s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process. The spikes latch on to human cells about four times more strongly than those on the related Sars coronavirus. This suggests that coronavirus particles inhaled through the nose or mouth have a high chance of attaching to cells in the upper respiratory tract, meaning relatively few are needed for an infection to gain a foothold.Find out more: Study sheds light on coronavirus infection mechanismWhat happens to people’s lungs when they get coronavirus?The cough and fever is a result of the infection reaching the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside. The lining of the air passages become injured, causing inflammation. The inflammation can spread throughout the lungs, causing them to fill with liquid, making breathing difficult. The lungs are then unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, which can cause death.Find out more: What happens to people’s lungs when they get coronavirus?Where did the coronavirus originate?The first recorded case of the coronavirus is believed to have emerged in November 2019 in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. Many of those first affected had worked in or visited the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the city of 11 million people.Have there been other coronaviruses?Yes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) were both caused by coronaviruses that made the leap from animals to humans. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750.What is the mortality rate of the new coronavirus?It is probably about or a bit less than 1%. The rate appears to be as high as 4% from globally confirmed case figures, but it is likely that many mild cases are going undetected. However a 1% mortality rate would still make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally. The death rate also increases significantly for people over 60.Why is it a pandemic and what does that mean?A pandemic is declared by WHO when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads in multiple countries simultaneously. Declaring a pandemic has nothing to do with changes to the characteristics of the disease or how dangerous it is.Find out more: What is a pandemic?When will there be a coronavirus vaccine?Currently there is no cure or vaccine for the coronavirus. Human trials are under way – but even if they go well and a cure is found, there are many barriers before global immunisation is feasible. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be considered quick.Find out more: When will a coronavirus vaccine will be ready?How does coronavirus affect our pets?There’s little evidence that domestic pets can catch the coronavirus, but contact between them and an infected person may help transmit the virus. It is recommended to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after coming into contact with any animal.Coronavirus overload: five ways to fight misinformation and fearPeople are being bombarded with new information at a time of heightened stress and it’s playing damaging games with our decision making.

But the idea of having to sit passively as toxic drugs are slowly funneled into my body has kept me up at night.The doctors told me that three days after the first treatment, the side effects will really start to hit me. A nurse told me about possible hearing loss. It’s a scary prospect as I pride myself on my bat-like hearing. She also asked whether I have a separate bathroom that my husband Eric and our two kids won’t use, because 24 hours after my first dose, my urine and sweat would start to become toxic.At that moment, the enormity of my situation came barreling through the walls of the hospital and hit me. I’m trying to keep me and my family safe from a deadly virus, which means staying inside and away from sick people. But I’m also trying to keep myself from dying of cervical cancer, which requires not only going to a hospital almost every day, but pumping toxic drugs into my system that I then bring home with me.The drive to the hospital for the appointment this morning took a fraction of the time it normally does. It was 9.15am and the roads were empty, except for a few drivers who seemed to have forgotten the meaning of a red light.Since Washington’s stay-home mandate came into effect to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the streets of Bellevue have been reduced to dog walkers and a very busy pick-up line for grocery store orders.My husband, Eric, dropped me off at the front of the hospital. I started feeling hot and sweaty, and I was breathing harder than normal.Several security guards were stationed just inside the entrance. I was told to stand in line on a blue piece of tape that kept everyone six feet apart from one another. A pair of nurses wearing long hospital gowns, masks and gloves asked if I’d had diarrhea in the last 72 hours, had been coughing or having trouble breathing. Then they took my temperature.As I walked over to the elevator, I noticed all of the side doors had been blocked off or were guarded by a hospital staff member. I used my sleeve to hit the elevator door, and relaxed a bit when no one else followed me inside such a confined space.On the second floor, nurses led me to a large chair that reclines and even has buttons for a built-in massage and heating. They gave me pillows and a blanket, and there was some cheese and fruit set out.I could see five other people getting treatment, but we were all spaced far apart from one another. I scrolled through Facebook and Twitter, watched some of the governor’s press conference and then put in my headphones to listen to the Hamilton soundtrack.With my 15-year-old son’s asthma and Eric’s artificial heart valve, we agreed no one would come with me into the hospital for these appointments. It was not an easy decision. But to be completely honest, as scared as I have been, the prospect of getting a four-hour break from my family was actually pretty appealing.The barrage of questions just wouldn’t stop: Did I wash everything off? Did I bring something home today?We’ve been cooped up together in the house for the past two weeks, except for occasional walks, doctors’ appointments and grocery store order pick-ups. My son, Michael, has started having weekly online movie nights with his friends, and both he and my daughter, James, who has autism, have been drawing a lot. They’re really good artists. I’m not sure where they get it. I can’t even write my name the same way twice.The doctors gave me anti-nausea medicine and steroids, so I felt a strange combination of tired and energized when I got home.Last night, I had fallen asleep on my living room couch at 4am, a little earlier than my new normal these days. The barrage of unending questions just wouldn’t stop: Did I wash everything off from the hospital visits? Did I bring something home today? How many days do I have before I start to feel sick?My doctor gave me a prescription for Xanax, so I hope that will help. I’ve never been on any type of anxiety medication before. But when we met in his office, with my chair set noticeably farther away from his desk, we both agreed that this was the right choice.My dad died two days ago. It had nothing to do with coronavirus, but it was sudden. He lives in Idaho and we haven’t spoken in five years for a number of reasons, including the fact that I knew he wouldn’t be able to accept my kids after they came out as LGBTQ.But I have been worried about how my three younger siblings are handling this, since they were close with him. One day after his death, Idaho’s governor announced a shelter-in-place order, which means they won’t be able to have a real funeral.I’ve been in touch with my siblings a lot recently, to try and help them as they clean out dad’s house. It’s actually been nice because it makes me feel like I’m doing something.I feel relieved that I no longer have to wonder about what will happen during chemo. I made it through the first appointment, so I know I can make it through the next four more.I’m still terrified about what the next few days and weeks will bring, but hopefully getting over that hurdle will be enough to calm my worried brain, at least for one night."

The US president told his daily coronavirus press conference: “All Americans are praying for him.”He added: “He’s a great friend of mine. I’m sure he is going to be fine. He’s a strong man, a strong person.”Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, and his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, both wished Johnson a speedy recovery while the former prime minister Tony Blair, who was hospitalised himself briefly in 2003 to correct an abnormal heart rhythm during his premiership, said Johnson’s hospital situation must be “hellish”.Blair told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I have every sympathy and solidarity with him. I know it must be a hellish situation to be in.”There were also messages of support from the Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran and the Labour backbencher David Lammy, one of Johnson’s fiercest critics, who said: “The whole country wants you to return to full health as soon as possible.”Get well soon @BorisJohnson. The whole country wants you to return to full health as soon as possible. https://t.co/LvvRBMDJVdThere were also calls for Johnson to reflect on his health and take time out from Downing Street if necessary rather than soldier on.The former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake said it would be “sensible” for Boris Johnson to “step back” if he was not well enough to carry out his role for now.He told the Today programme: “I think in the end if he’s not well, he will have to reflect on this because the job’s tough at the best of times and it’s doubly tough now.”Michael Gove’s wife, the Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, suggested Johnson’s failure to shake off the virus was linked to his commitment to continue leading the nation’s battle against the virus. “Boris has worked non-stop throughout his illness – and now we see the result,” she tweeted.Boris has worked non-stop throughout his illness - and now we see the result.Asked whether Johnson should hand over control during his illness, Blair said: “I’m not going to second guess them on that.“He knows the state of his own condition and he will be judging it carefully himself, I’m sure.”A Downing Street spokeswoman said the prime minister’s admission to hospital had been a precautionary move taken “on the advice of his doctor” because he had continued to have “persistent symptoms” 10 days after testing positive for the virus.Johnson tested positive last month along with Matt Hancock, who has recovered. His chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, also self-isolated.Johnson’s pregnant 32-year-old fiancee, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday she was feeling better.From an apartment above 11 Downing Street, and with food brought to his door, Johnson continued to lead the government’s response and chaired meetings via video conference.He has posted a series of video messages since then, initially appearing in a suit and tie, but in the latest post on Friday he appeared weary, sitting in a chair with his shirt open at the neck.“Although I’m feeling better and I’ve done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,” he said.The pound briefly fell 0.4% against the US dollar to $1.2215 on the news before trimming some losses to trade at $1.2230, down 0.3%."

Regarded as a precursor to the Iranian new wave and now considered a classic, The House Is Black is a documentary about the members of a leper colony near the city of Tabriz in northwest Iran. Despite having been filmed nearly 60 years ago, and focusing on a small group of people suffering from a particular condition, it has found new relevance in the age of the coronavirus pandemic, having much to say not only about the current situation in Iran but also to those in self-isolation and/or suffering, regardless of location.Farrokhzad’s short film is anything but an easy watch. Ebrahim Golestan, its producer (who was in a secret relationship with Farrokhzad at the time) states this explicitly at the start. “On this screen,” he says, “will appear an image of ugliness, a vision of pain no caring human being should ignore.” This echoes the sentiments of the poet Sa’di of Shiraz, who in the 13th century famously declared: “You who are indifferent to the misery of others cannot be called a human being.”Golestan’s “ugliness”, however, turns out to be something of a euphemism. While some of Farrokhzad’s subjects are being treated for leprosy at an early stage, others haven’t been as fortunate. In the first scene, a girl regards what is exposed of her mutilated face in a mirror. Elsewhere a blind, noseless man handles a cigarette with mere stubs for fingers. Farrokhzad does not, however, treat any of them as anomalies or grotesques but as people; and her empathy is accentuated by her passionate readings of her poetry. “Let us listen to the soul,” she says, “who sings in the remote desert, the one who sighs and stretches his hands out, saying, ‘Alas, my wounds have numbed my spirit.’”In his preface, Golestan says that the motive and hope of the film is “to wipe out this ugliness and relieve the victims”; but The House Is Black is a little more complex than that. According to Nasrin Rahimieh, professor of comparative literature at the University of California, Farrokhzad told Bernardo Bertolucci that “she saw the leper colony as an example or a model of a world imprisoned by its illnesses, difficulties, and poverty”. Rahimieh suggests that “life in the leper colony is a metaphor for life in general”. Hamid Dabashi, professor of Iranian studies and comparative literature at Columbia University, and Roxanne Varzi, a professor of anthropology and film at the University of California, suggest, respectively, that the film reflects the “brutalised history” of Iran, and serves as a metaphor for “the Shah’s oppressive social policies and a critique of the practice of religion at the time”.The House Is Black has taken on even more meaning in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. For one, it can make those self-isolating appreciate what they have. Our pandemic will pass, but for the quarantined patients in the film, especially those with advanced leprosy, illness and isolation from the rest of society are facts of life. They have no recovery to look forward to, passing out their days in a slow decay. “I am poured out like water … as those who have long been dead,” Farrokhzad says in her voiceover. “On my eyelids is the shadow of death.”That said, there is some light in the film: children giggle at school and while playing football, dealing with the situation as best they can, while other patients are shown making merry at a wedding. The film’s contrasting of scenes in a hospital in which Golestan discusses the treatment of leprosy, with those of fatalistic worshippers submitting to the will of God in a mosque, says volumes about the conflicting attitudes of and towards science and religion in Iran.On that note, the “house” in the film (ie, the colony) can certainly stand as a metaphor for coronavirus-era Iran: a pariah nation battling a pandemic under crippling US sanctions costing ordinary Iranians their lives at an alarming rate. In perhaps the film’s most harrowing scene, a schoolboy is asked to write a sentence on the blackboard with the word “house”. He thinks to himself before scrawling with his damaged fingers: “The house is black.”"
"174","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-is-draining-americas-public-infrastructure-a-federal-jobs-policy-would-protect-its-workers","2020-04-06T06:15:54-0400","  
 Coronavirus is draining America's public infrastructure. A federal jobs policy would protect its workers ","Last week, more than six million people applied for unemployment, the largest jump in unemployment claims in our country’s history. The Federal Reserve estimates that the Covid-19 pandemic could lead to 47 million Americans losing their jobs in the weeks to come. With little hope of being re-hired, these workers will struggle to stay healthy, feed their children, and pay rent on the meager, one-time $1,200 check authorized by the most recent federal stimulus package.At the same time, we face the consequences of starving our public infrastructure. Our cities are deficient in resources and underprepared for a pandemic epidemiologists have been warning government officials would be coming. Despite claims that ours is the best healthcare system in the world, our hospitals and nursing homes do not have sufficient masks, gloves, protective gear, flu tests, ventilators, hand sanitizer, or disinfectant wipes to protect either their own staff or their patients. We need workers to produce these essential products.We know that millions of workers right now need jobs. We need to put Americans to work in good, well-paying jobs making the supplies and providing the services that we need as a nation to thrive. Radically expanding federal employment to put these displaced workers to work is in the interest of our national security.If a federal jobs guarantee policy were enacted, the federal government would be empowered to provide both a living wage and health insurance to the recently unemployed. They would be put back to work manufacturing the supplies our nation’s healthcare workers desperately need and providing the essential services necessary to keep our nation’s schoolchildren, elderly and vulnerable fed and cared for during this frightening time. These jobs would pay a living wage of at least $15 an hour and include healthcare benefits. Instead of bailing out the stock market, our federal government could instead organize a civic labor force working for the health and security of American families through this continuing pandemic.There is clear historical precedent for this type of response during a crisis. During the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt introduced the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which provided jobs for workers who needed them aimed at strengthening the public infrastructure and building prosperity for the next generation of American children.Dramatically expanding AmeriCorps, an existing federal program which already employs thousands of workers in various civic improvement projects, would put more people to work in service to their communities. What would these federally-employed workers get paid to do? The United States might follow the example of other developed nations in nationalizing essential manufacturing. This was exactly the purpose and scope of the Defense Production Act. No factory capable of producing masks, protective gear, hand sanitizer, or ventilators should be standing idle through a healthcare crisis. Failing to use these resources for the benefit of the greater good during a deadly pandemic is unacceptable.No factory should be standing idle through a healthcare crisis. Failing to use these resources during a deadly pandemic is unacceptableMedical supplies are not the only things America needs to survive this pandemic. According to CNN, while some food banks are shutting down, others are reporting that demand has quadrupled. Food pantries are unable to keep up with demand, as laid-off workers seek food assistance and volunteers are stuck at home. Right now, the National Guard is employed in this essential work of feeding those who cannot feed themselves. Given that summer is coming, and with it forest fires and hurricanes, it is only a matter of time before we will need them elsewhere. Preparing and delivering meals safely is obviously a critical mission for our federal government during a pandemic, and the administration should be making plans to employ civilian workers to perform this essential labor.In the absence of a larger government response that genuinely recognizes the unprecedented precarity of the typical American wage earner, families are turning to GoFundMe. Hundreds and hundreds of pages in the last two weeks have been set up to help neighborhoods provide food to the vulnerable, to donate money to laid off restaurant workers, and pay for health-related costs. In no way is this a sustainable or ethical safety net in the richest nation on earth.In these times of great inequality, where millions of American workers face an uncertain employment future, a federal jobs guarantee program could turn the page on a dark chapter of our nation’s history. New York and Texas have both enlisted the incarcerated to make hand sanitizer, as prison labor is cheap and the incarcerated have little recourse. Meanwhile, those in dire need of income are working without protective equipment or health insurance to provide food delivery to those who are able to self-quarantine and work from home.While some may suggest employing people during a pandemic might put them at risk, it is clear that “essential” workers are already doing these jobs for lower pay, no benefits, and with insufficient protective equipment. Providing this option, alongside robust unemployment benefits and other essential labor protections, will make both workers and our society safer.Without a federal effort to provide economic security and health insurance to those who need it, the most vulnerable Americans will continue to put their lives at risk, exacerbating inequality and making recovery even harder. As Donald Trump weighs a job program as part of a larger investment in infrastructure, a federal jobs guarantee must be an essential part of the package.Cassandra Robertson, PhD, is a postdoctoral fellow at the Cornell Population Center, where she researches economic mobility and social policy.Holly Wood, PhD, is an independent scholar, writer and activist."

However, this was the weakest March since the late 90s, when the twice-yearly number plate change was introduced.Britain’s car industry was already struggling before the pandemic – hit by a combination of falling sales, a shift away from diesel vehicles and Brexit uncertainty.Direct cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to £2,500 a month. There are similar wage subsidies for employees.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The figures are a stark indication of what happens when economies grind to a halt, said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT.“How long the market remains stalled is uncertain but it will reopen and the products will be there. In the meantime, we will continue to work with government to do all we can to ensure the thousands of people employed in this sector are ready for work,” he said.Dramatic falls in new car sales have been reported in other European countries that introduced lockdowns earlier than Britain, including Italy, where sales fell 85% in March, France, down 72%, and Spain, which was 69% lower.The second quarter will be the most difficult for the auto industry, according to the investment bank JP Morgan, which has downgraded its global car production forecast for Europe, the Americas and China from 9% to a 19% fall compared with 2019.Forecasts suggest the continued closure of car plants across Europe and North America will cost the auto industry more than $100bn (£82bn) in lost revenues if the shutdown lasts until the end of April.All major European carmakers have suspended production because of disruption caused by the spread of the coronavirus and if this continues as expected until the end of April, this will account for €66bn (£58bn) in lost sales in Europe, or 2.6m cars. In North America it would lead to lost sales of about $52bn (£42bn), or 2m cars.The calculations have been made by Ian Henry, the owner of the consultancy AutoAnalysis, who produces forecasts for the SMMT, along with the automotive team at consultancy GlobalData.Assembly lines ground to a halt in March as the lockdown across Europe disrupted global supply chains, and analysts predicted large falls in demand in all key markets.All volume manufacturers from BMW to Toyota and Nissan to Jaguar Land Rover sent their workers home after the worsening outbreak on the continent led companies to examine the health implications for their workers.The story was repeated across North America as the Detroit carmakers, including General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, shut down their plants.Auto firms initially closed their sites for a number of weeks, saying they would keep the situation under review, but the shutdown is anticipated to last longer than first expected.Henry predicts that each additional week of plant closures in Europe will cost the industry an extra €8bn (£7bn) in lost production value and similarly $7.5bn (£6bn) in North America.International supply chains complicate the question of when car plants can reopen, Henry said, while it is also difficult to predict when consumers will starting buying cars again.“What will be the state of consumer demand after this?” Henry said. “Will the man in the street want to buy a new car? A huge proportion of cars go to companies and fleet managers won’t be looking to buy cars for executives.”"

There has been one recorded Covid-19 death in the county, Clinton Cobbins, Lexington’s first African American mayor. But even now the coronavirus still poses a serious threat to life.In Holmes county consolidated – the school district to which Lexington belongs – every single child qualifies for free school meals, a marker of pervasive poverty. For many, said superintendent Dr James L Henderson, breakfast and lunch at school are the only nutritious meals a student will eat in a day. For a few, they are the only meals.When the coronavirus pandemic led to statewide school closures, Henderson, who was born in the county, left for most of his adult life, but returned in 2018 to assume his position, was left with a significant dilemma: how to feed the 3,000 children under his authority.Many children in this rural district come from households too poor to afford a car. So the superintendent embarked on an improvised project, driving 6,000 meals a day out across the county in a small fleet of 70 school buses, dropping each packet off at a stop along the route.“We absolutely see this as a matter of life and death,” he said. “We have to do it on behalf of our children. It’s just that simple. Families are suffering here.”“If there is a silver lining to Covid-19, even in the poorest county in the poorest state, we genuinely care about each other. We are working to that end to make sure we’re providing for all children.The novel strategy underlines the escalating crisis the coronavirus has imposed on Mississippi, America’s most food insecure state. In Holmes county 35% of residents are already food insecure, according to recent research and that number is certain to rise substantially as the coronavirus pandemic takes hold.As the yellow school bus pulled into one driveway, nine-year-old Keizarrian Thomas dashed from his porch and collected three lunch packages – two for his brothers. A juice box, three celery sticks and a ham sandwich in each.His mother, Felichia Walden, had just been furloughed from her job at a local car company because of the virus.“With the money that we do have we’ve got to try and pay the bills,” she said. “And when you go to the grocery store you can hardly get things.”At the next stop, a few hundred feet down the street, Arletha Gaston took four meals for her children who sat on the stoop of their trailer home, playing tag in the morning sun.Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs. As this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help.The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families.If you want to help, find your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund.Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use Feeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice.Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.“This is getting so much harder,” she said. “We’re trying to get out of town to look for better deals on food.”Holmes county, with a population of 18,000 people, has only two fresh grocery stores and both face allegations of price gouging during the pandemic.Zelpha Whatley, who hosts a weekly local call in radio show, said countless listeners, many of whom receive food stamps to purchase their basic groceries, had complained on her show about rising prices – in some instances tripling or quadrupling the price.“I couldn’t believe these two stores would take advantage of the situation,” she said. “So I went to one to check myself. When I saw the price of eggs had doubled, I walked out and said ‘I’m not paying’. My brain just melted because I was so upset.”In a brief phone interview the owner of Lexington’s only grocery store, Roy Sims, denied he had inflated prices for profit, arguing produce, including eggs, dairy and meat, had risen at wholesale. Sims declined to cite specific margins.“If people have a problem they should report it to the Attorney General of Mississippi,” he said. “We’re not talking to anyone else about price gouging.”Mississippi may still be at the early stage of the pandemic compared to other hotspots in the US – particularly neighbouring Louisiana. Thirty-five people have died of Covid-19 here with 1,455 cases statewide. But the state already has the highest rate of hospitalizations due to coronavirus, according to analysis by Mississippi Today.As the school bus food drop offs concluded their lunchtime run last Wednesday, Republican governor Tate Reeves announced a state-wide shelter in place order, after days of criticism his administration had been too slow to act.“I pray that all of our orders and preparations will be enough. We believe that this is the right tool at the right time to save lives,” Reeves said.But the virus has already amplified food insecurity across Mississippi, not just in Holmes county.“Hunger is rampant here,” said Charles Beadie, CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, the only in-state foodbank that distributes to 415 agencies. “600,000 were already going to bed hungry or not knowing how they will get their meal.”The network is under major pressure in the first few weeks of the crisis. A number of agencies have closed down due to volunteers being afraid of infection. At least one county in the state now has no access to food bank resources. The network is chronically understaffed and free labor from the state’s prison network is no longer available due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, demand has surged.“We have more phone calls than we can handle,” Beadie said, acknowledging his organization was struggling to quantify the increased scale of demand.In Jackson, the state’s capital city, volunteers have begun running hot meal services to some of the city’s poorest neighbourhoods.Like Holmes county and dozens of other districts in the state, every child in Jackson qualifies for free school meals. And while the school district continues to offer a pick up meal service there are no drop offs here.April Jackson, a 30-year-old mother of seven, has no car and said she had been unable to pick up meals for her children provided by the school.Volunteers from the Poor People’s Campaign, and Operation Good – a local collective of activists – have been organizing hot food drop offs at this low income apartment complex, for the past week.“It’s like a scavenger hunt,” Jackson said as residents queued for handouts. “People are going crazy and everyone is on the hunt for food.”She lost her part-time job this week at a school cafeteria and is now completely reliant on handouts and food stamps to feed her family. She received $278 in weekly food benefits before the crisis and had expected more after the state announced an increase in emergency benefits to families. She said she got just $6 more.“I just took it,” she said. “I bought a block of cheese. That was it.”"

 Fear, bigotry and misinformation – this reminds me of the 1980s Aids pandemic ","I am a gay man who lived through the Aids pandemic, so many people have asked me to compare that crisis with the one we now face. The main difference between the two is that Aids at first appeared to afflict specific populations, while coronavirus is an equal opportunity malady. I remember when I visited Paris in 1981 I told Michel Foucault, the French philosopher, about Aids and he laughed at this American invention that seemed to target both gay men and Haitians. He said: “That’s too perfect, blacks and gays, only American racists and puritans would have come up with that delusion.” He died from the disease in 1984.In the mid-80s, I wrote an article in which I said American gays, at least younger ones, had worked through their self-hatred in the post-Stonewall 70s but that internalised homophobia had come back with the Aids stigma in the 1980s. We knew we were a hated community; relatives wouldn’t let us hold their babies. Eventually the viral nature of the disease became known and we discovered the only two significant modes of transmission were blood and semen, but in the early days people feared physical contact, mosquitoes, kisses, coughs. Actually, coronavirus is much more easily communicated than Aids ever was.I was the first president and one of the six founders of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis in 1981; we felt we were so isolated, so alone, in our struggle that we could only imagine giving a disco fundraiser for gay men. When later I observed Foucault’s widower, Daniel Defert, in 1985 start the charity Aides, I was impressed that he went immediately to the French health minister; American gays had such low self-esteem they (we) didn’t think we had the right to societal concern.Aids bore a badge of shame even in the gay community – if you were infected it was your own fault for not practising safe sex – whereas everyone feels sympathy for coronavirus victims. Whereas Aids was a death sentence for almost all who were afflicted, most people with coronavirus show only mild symptoms and even those who are hospitalised mostly recover. Whereas doctors and nurses did not get Aids from working with patients (except for a few unfortunate healthcare and lab workers who accidentally were contaminated with infected blood) health workers are highly vulnerable to coronavirus, and shortages of protective equipment only increase this vulnerability.Coronavirus is the first pandemic of the social media era, and misinformation, conspiracy theories and racist slurs flood various public sites. Have you heard the one that Boris Johnson invented the infection in order to win back public sympathy? Such scandals were also perpetrated by hearsay in the Aids era, but social media has amplified them.While the rumour mill might be taking the same approach, official pronouncements from the White House take a different tack. Ronald Reagan only mentioned Aids once, whereas Donald Trump has turned his daily televised briefings into self-congratulatory rallies. Which is worse? Presidential indifference or the politicisation of the bully-pulpit (not to mention Trumpian rumours)? Remember when Trump said there were just a few cases in America and those were being cured, that the virus would vanish miraculously? Or remember when he wouldn’t let the sick passengers disembark from a cruise ship because that would augment “his” numbers? Just as Aids was first dubbed Gay-Related Immune Deficiency (Grid), the president has worked hard to dub this virus the “Chinese virus”.Both pandemics have had their folklore “origin” stories. Randy Shilts in his 1987 book And the Band Played On later claimed he was forced by his publisher to pin the American spread of Aids on “patient zero”, a handsome Canadian flight attendant, just as the American plague is being traced back to a mythical Wuhan businessman. At least most educated people don’t try to locate the person who “gave” them coronavirus, whereas many Aids patients sought to blame a particular sex partner. Now the contacts are ubiquitous and might be your granddaughter or nephew or your murderous teen who’s still playing basketball or enjoying spring break in Florida.Ironically, the same doctor, Anthony Fauci, was the “villain” of the Aids epidemic (the activist group Act-Up accused him of not releasing life-saving drugs) and is the hero of coronavirus (the voice of scientific reason in the Trump administration). In both epidemics he has insisted on running studies of new drugs. In the crazy Trumpian far right he has been accused of undermining the president’s looniest pronouncements.Aids victims could be all ages and all physical conditions, and they often took years to die, meanwhile parading their skeletal bodies or Kaposi’s sarcoma stigmata. Whereas the characterisation of people who die of coronavirus is of those already old and sick from underlying conditions, the stereotypical Aids patient started out as a buff 30-year-old weightlifter. But cynics would say the coronavirus patient has already outlived his or her sell-by date (this callousness strikes me, as an 80-year-old). A French aristocrat spoke delicately of Talleyrand’s cruel indifference to the tragedy of his émigré intimates by calling it his “too great sense of resignation when it came to the unhappiness of his friends”.Whereas Elizabeth Taylor’s compassion and Aids fundraising, for instance, seemed remarkable, New York governor Andrew Cuomo’s intelligent take-charge attitude sets the civilised norm. In any event, by embracing the coronavirus cause, he runs no risk to his reputation.Aids was surrounded from the beginning by moral opprobrium in America, especially because the disease was linked with perversion and sexual excess; coronavirus is already associated with maskless renegades who don’t keep their social distance.Whereas I became positive for Aids in 1985, I survived because I was a “slow progressor” and my T-cell count fell very, very gradually. Now I’m going into my third week of coronavirus quarantine – I wonder if I’ll survive this one.• Edmund White is the author of 30 books.

"178","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/drive-by-strauss-hungarian-orchestra-airs-concerts-from-cars","2020-04-06T05:46:55-0400","  Drive-by Strauss: Hungarian orchestra airs concerts from cars ","Over the past week, Attila Kovács has been playing music to entertain the residents of Budapest, just as he has done for more than three decades as a viola player in the city’s MAV symphony orchestra.These days, however, the orchestra’s “performances” look rather different from usual. Hungary, like almost every other country in Europe, has banned large gatherings of people because of the coronavirus crisis, making live concerts impossible.Many orchestras and opera houses have instead taken to streaming archive performances online, but the MAV orchestra has drawn on its unique, itinerant history to take things a step further.Every day, musicians from the orchestra drive two cars mounted with loudspeakers around Budapest and its surroundings, belting out recordings of past performances. It is currently forbidden to leave the house except for essential activities in Hungary, but the idea is that people should open up their windows or step on to their balconies and enjoy an uplifting blast of classical music.“It seems like we managed to make many generations very happy with playing music, even in these weird, stressful times,” said Kovács, who said that while pensioners formed the majority of the audience, in recent days young people too had been enjoying the music.“People came out to the streets, keeping the proper distance between each other, and started to clap and give us a thumbs up. Some of them were even dancing,” he said.The reaction over the past week has been almost universally positive, said Kálmán Kovács, a trumpeter in the orchestra who has been driving one of the cars. An elderly woman conducted from her balcony, a trio of young foreigners danced “as though they were in a nightclub” to a Strauss waltz, and a truck driver wound down his window and asked for the volume to be increased as cyclists stopped to listen.There was only one negative reaction, a woman who raced angrily on to the street to shout that her child was sleeping and they should turn the music off immediately. The music selection changes daily, but is always drawn from recordings of the orchestra and there is an emphasis on light and uplifting music. “We’re not going to be playing the Shostakovich Leningrad symphony,” joked György Lendvai, the orchestra’s managing director. If people want to request an appearance near their homes, they can message the orchestra’s Facebook account with their address.Lendvai said the idea came from the orchestra’s unique history as the house ensemble of MAV, the Hungarian railway network. It was set up at the end of the second world war by the music-loving head of the state railway concern, who felt music was essential to lift the people’s spirits in the ruins of postwar Hungary.It was initially a brass and wind ensemble, and later it became a full orchestra. With communist rule firmly entrenched, it became an arm of the Soviet ideal of bringing high culture to the masses, and was the orchestra for the so-called “rolling opera” which took operatic performances to the provinces. For the first decade, the orchestra performed in navy-blue railway uniforms.The railway provided the orchestra with three coaches: one for male musicians, one for female musicians and one for the instruments and props. Most weeks for several decades, the orchestra would leave Budapest for the provinces and perform symphonic concerts and operas in small towns or sometimes even in factories, before returning to sleep in the railway carriages and then moving on to the next destination. On Fridays, the orchestra would be back in Budapest and perform in the opulent surroundings of the city’s Liszt Academy.“Even now, when I’m in the smallest village in the countryside and say I work for the MAV orchestra, there will always be someone elderly who says: ‘Oh, that orchestra was the first time I ever heard classical music or the opera,’” said Lendvai.After the fall of communism, the orchestra began to travel more abroad, but it is still partially funded by Hungarian railways, and it was this history that formed the basis for the current idea of bringing music to residents on lockdown.“Today we have a crisis and I think people need to be cheered up and given a little hope,” said Lendvai. “But right now we cannot do it with an orchestra. So we thought that we could bring music by car to all the people in quarantine in their home.”"

The company disclosed the number on Friday.The airline has been under pressure from the government to operate more repatriation flights to bring Australians back from cruises and parts of the world that had much higher levels of coronavirus infections.Under the exemption, crews do not have to go into isolation for 14 days meaning they are free to go to supermarkets and go home to their families, raising the potential for community spread. Health workers are also covered by the exemption, although NSW has just announced it will provide free accommodation and food for health workers so they do not have to return to their homes after shifts.Qantas medical director, Dr Ian Hosegood, said the airline was complying with all of the requirements issued by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.“Crew who return home must also comply with the social isolating requirements currently enforced in the state or territory in which they live just like any other member of the public.”Staff at Qantas have been alarmed at the lack of personal protective equipment that have been provided by the airline as the coronavirus unfolded. They are now wearing masks and gloves during cabin duties.This is not the only flight where crew have been infected. NSW Health has published long lists of flights on which passengers who had the virus travelled, listing the nearby rows.A number of these were flights that carried passengers from the Ruby Princess back to other states. More than 600 passengers from the cruise ship have now come down with Covid-19 and several have died.Qantas insiders said that some of the Qantas cases are associated with those Ruby Princess flights.It comes as Qantas and Virgin Australia prepare to resume international services with government-subsidised flights to London, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Auckland to bring stranded Australians home.A repatriation flight, organised by the government, is due to leave Peru later this week."
"180","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/when-will-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready","2020-04-06T04:55:36-0400","  When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? ","Even at their most effective – and draconian – containment strategies have only slowed the spread of the respiratory disease Covid-19. With the World Health Organization finally declaring a pandemic, all eyes have turned to the prospect of a vaccine, because only a vaccine can prevent people from getting sick.About 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to create such a vaccine, at least four of which already have candidates they have been testing in animals. The first of these – produced by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna – will enter human trials imminently.This unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to early Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. China shared that sequence in early January, allowing research groups around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick.But there is another reason for the head start. Though nobody could have predicted that the next infectious disease to threaten the globe would be caused by a coronavirus – flu is generally considered to pose the greatest pandemic risk – vaccinologists had hedged their bets by working on “prototype” pathogens. “The speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,” says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Oslo-based nonprofit the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is leading efforts to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development.Coronaviruses have caused two other recent epidemics – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China in 2002-04, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In both cases, work began on vaccines that were later shelved when the outbreaks were contained. One company, Maryland-based Novavax, has now repurposed those vaccines for Sars-CoV-2, and says it has several candidates ready to enter human trials this spring. Moderna, meanwhile, built on earlier work on the Mers virus conducted at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland.Sars-CoV-2 shares between 80% and 90% of its genetic material with the virus that caused Sars – hence its name. Both consist of a strip of ribonucleic acid (RNA) inside a spherical protein capsule that is covered in spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung – the same type of receptor in both cases – allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell’s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process.All vaccines work according to the same basic principle. They present part or all of the pathogen to the human immune system, usually in the form of an injection and at a low dose, to prompt the system to produce antibodies to the pathogen. Antibodies are a kind of immune memory which, having been elicited once, can be quickly mobilised again if the person is exposed to the virus in its natural form.Traditionally, immunisation has been achieved using live, weakened forms of the virus, or part or whole of the virus once it has been inactivated by heat or chemicals. These methods have drawbacks. The live form can continue to evolve in the host, for example, potentially recapturing some of its virulence and making the recipient sick, while higher or repeat doses of the inactivated virus are required to achieve the necessary degree of protection. Some of the Covid-19 vaccine projects are using these tried-and-tested approaches, but others are using newer technology. One more recent strategy – the one that Novavax is using, for example – constructs a “recombinant” vaccine. This involves extracting the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of Sars-CoV-2, which is the part of the virus most likely to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and pasting it into the genome of a bacterium or yeast – forcing these microorganisms to churn out large quantities of the protein. Other approaches, even newer, bypass the protein and build vaccines from the genetic instruction itself. This is the case for Moderna and another company which has a presence in Boston, CureVac, both of which are building Covid-19 vaccines out of messenger RNA.Cepi’s original portfolio of four funded Covid-19 vaccine projects was heavily skewed towards these more innovative technologies, and last week it announced $4.4m (£3.4m) of partnership funding with Novavax and with a University of Oxford vectored vaccine project. “Our experience with vaccine development is that you can’t anticipate where you’re going to stumble,” says Hatchett, meaning that diversity is key. And the stage where any approach is most likely to stumble is clinical or human trials, which, for some of the candidates, are about to get under way.Clinical trials, an essential precursor to regulatory approval, usually take place in three phases. The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is, and the third does the same in several thousand people. But there’s a high level of attrition as experimental vaccines pass through these phases. “Not all horses that leave the starting gate will finish the race,” says Bruce Gellin, who runs the global immunisation programme for the Washington DC-based nonprofit, the Sabin Vaccine Institute.There are good reasons for that. Either the candidates are unsafe, or they’re ineffective, or both. Screening out duds is essential, which is why clinical trials can’t be skipped or hurried. Approval can be accelerated if regulators have approved similar products before. The annual flu vaccine, for example, is the product of a well-honed assembly line in which only one or a few modules have to be updated each year. In contrast, Sars-CoV-2 is a novel pathogen in humans, and many of the technologies being used to build vaccines are relatively untested too. No vaccine made from genetic material – RNA or DNA – has been approved to date, for example. So the Covid-19 vaccine candidates have to be treated as brand new vaccines, and as Gellin says: “While there is a push to do things as fast as possible, it’s really important not to take shortcuts.”An illustration of that is a vaccine that was produced in the 1960s against respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in children. In clinical trials, this vaccine was found to aggravate those symptoms in infants who went on to catch the virus. A similar effect was observed in animals given an early experimental Sars vaccine. It was later modified to eliminate that problem but, now that it has been repurposed for Sars-CoV-2, it will need to be put through especially stringent safety testing to rule out the risk of enhanced disease.It’s for these reasons that taking a vaccine candidate all the way to regulatory approval typically takes a decade or more, and why President Trump sowed confusion when, at a meeting at the White House on 2 March, he pressed for a vaccine to be ready by the US elections in November – an impossible deadline. “Like most vaccinologists, I don’t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That’s already extremely fast, and it assumes there will be no hitches.In the meantime, there is another potential problem. As soon as a vaccine is approved, it’s going to be needed in vast quantities – and many of the organisations in the Covid-19 vaccine race simply don’t have the necessary production capacity. Vaccine development is already a risky affair, in business terms, because so few candidates get anywhere near the clinic. Production facilities tend to be tailored to specific vaccines, and scaling these up when you don’t yet know if your product will succeed is not commercially feasible. Cepi and similar organisations exist to shoulder some of the risk, keeping companies incentivised to develop much-needed vaccines. Cepi plans to invest in developing a Covid-19 vaccine and boosting manufacturing capacity in parallel, and earlier this month it put out a call for $2bn to allow it to do so.Once a Covid-19 vaccine has been approved, a further set of challenges will present itself. “Getting a vaccine that’s proven to be safe and effective in humans takes one at best about a third of the way to what’s needed for a global immunisation programme,” says global health expert Jonathan Quick of Duke University in North Carolina, author of The End of Epidemics (2018). “Virus biology and vaccines technology could be the limiting factors, but politics and economics are far more likely to be the barrier to immunisation.”The problem is making sure the vaccine gets to all those who need it. This is a challenge even within countries, and some have worked out guidelines. In the scenario of a flu pandemic, for example, the UK would prioritise vaccinating healthcare and social care workers, along with those considered at highest medical risk – including children and pregnant women – with the overall goal of keeping sickness and death ra tes as low as possible. But in a pandemic, countries also have to compete with each other for medicines.Because pandemics tend to hit hardest those countries that have the most fragile and underfunded healthcare systems, there is an inherent imbalance between need and purchasing power when it comes to vaccines. During the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, for example, vaccine supplies were snapped up by nations that could afford them, leaving poorer ones short. But you could also imagine a scenario where, say, India – a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world – not unreasonably decides to use its vaccine production to protect its own 1.3 billion-strong population first, before exporting any.Outside of pandemics, the WHO brings governments, charitable foundations and vaccine-makers together to agree an equitable global distribution strategy, and organisations like Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have come up with innovative funding mechanisms to raise money on the markets for ensuring supply to poorer countries. But each pandemic is different, and no country is bound by any arrangement the WHO proposes – leaving many unknowns. As Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, points out: “The question is, what will happen in a situation where you’ve got national emergencies going on?”This is being debated, but it will be a while before we see how it plays out. The pandemic, says Wilder-Smith, “will probably have peaked and declined before a vaccine is available”. A vaccine could still save many lives, especially if the virus becomes endemic or perennially circulating – like flu – and there are further, possibly seasonal, outbreaks. But until then, our best hope is to contain the disease as far as possible. To repeat the sage advice: wash your hands.This article was amended on 19 March 2020.

This is Ben Doherty bringing you the main stories on Monday 6 April.Australia’s death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic has reached 41, with nearly 5,800 confirmed infections.Australians aged in their 30s without risk factors are battling coronavirus in intensive care, prompting a wake-up call from health authorities. There are 96 people in intensive care, with 35 on ventilators.Deputy Chief Medical Officer Prof Paul Kelly warned that anyone, regardless of age, could be vulnerable to the virus. “This is not just an old person’s disease,” he said.“This is something that can affect the whole of our population and that is why we need the whole of the population to continue to take this seriously.”Kelly said it was important to note the small cohort of young people had no additional risk factors.“This is a disease which mostly is mild, but on some occasions we have seen and will continue to see people with severe disease,” he said.Kelly said increased cases meant a higher chance of younger people without vulnerability contracting a serious infection.“This is a wake-up call for all of us,” he said.Long lines have formed outside supermarkets after Coles, Woolworths and IGA began limiting the number of customers inside stores in a bid to allow physical distancing and keep flattening the curve of Covid-19 infections during the Easter rush.The Thursday before Easter is traditionally one of the busiest days for supermarkets, as people stock up for the weekend.However, in an attempt to avoid overcrowding, a number of Australian supermarkets have instituted “one in one out” policies.Celebrated New South Wales Rural Fire Services boss Shane Fitzsimmons has made the “absolutely difficult and deeply personal” decision to step down, and will instead head up a new agency aimed at ensuring the state’s resilience amid major challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic.The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced the establishment of Resilience NSW on Monday, saying it would ensure the state was prepared and able to respond to crises – “be it Covid, be it cybersecurity, be it a whole range of things we may not foreshadow”.The prevalence of Covid-19 in Australia could peak in mid-April and new cases reduce to almost zero by July, according to modelling by the University of Sydney.But the story doesn’t end there: without widespread testing to detect asymptomatic cases of Covid-19, and a firm hold on social distancing measures that remain in place up to four weeks after the person with the last known infection has recovered, the curve will shoot back up.“That’s pretty much the exit strategy,” said Prof Mikhail Prokopenko, a pandemic modelling expert and the director of the Centre for Complex Systems at Sydney University, who is leading the modelling team. “It must be based in testing.”The modelling is based on 90% compliance with social distancing rules.Peter Collignon, professor of infectious disease at Australian National University Medical School writes that some of Australia’s recently introduced restrictions “appear more as a result of panicked political decisions rather than based on biological plausibility or evidence”.“Some states have now put in overzealous rules and ones that give very mixed messages or have little biological plausibility. Not only will this cause unwarranted and increased social, mental and economic harm, we run the bigger risk that a substantial part of our society in a few months’ time (our winter) might increasingly rebel against many restrictions.“I hope NSW and Victoria can be persuaded to relax on their overzealous restrictions so recently and unnecessarily put in place.”Globally, there have been 69,498 deaths from Covid-19 (at the time of publishing), and more than 1.25m confirmed infections. The British prime minister Boris Johnson has been hospitalised after showing persistent symptoms of the virus more than 10 days after announcing he had tested positive.Donald Trump said the US government had ordered 29m doses of hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria for which testing for its use to treat coronavirus is still under way. The drug has potentially harmful side-effects. Personal protective gear is also being airlifted to US affected states, including millions of masks, gloves, and sterile gowns.Australia’s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questionsCoronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statisticsAustralia’s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelinesFree childcare: what do the Australian government’s coronavirus changes mean for my family?Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

We’ve been very nice to the government, we’ve played very nice. But with no parliament – is that a sustainable way for a democracy to go? No, it’s not.”Her stand was reflected in Australia Institute polling released on Monday showing 68% of voters wanted an oversight committee, similar to a body established in New Zealand. Just 13% of voters opposed the idea.Before it was suspended, the New Zealand parliament established a parliamentary committee including representatives of all political parties, which will publicly broadcast hearings.“This research indicates the Australian public’s trust and confidence in the decisions of the government in this time of crisis would be enhanced by a powerful parliamentary oversight committee ,” said Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute.“When decisions are being made so rapidly, often with imperfect information, a New Zealand style Covid-19 parliamentary oversight committee will go a long way to giving the public confidence in the decisions being made.“Australians are being asked to trade away significant civil liberties in the interests of public health. Increased public confidence in how these measures are being determined will go a long way to ensuring Australians take heed.”The federal houses will return on Wednesday for what is expected to be a single sitting day, the first in 16 days. The relegation of parliament’s importance will be highlighted by a meeting on Tuesday of the national cabinet of federal and state leaders, who have had at least two conferences a week for the past month.Labor and key crossbench MPs will call for a Senate committee to oversee Scott Morrison’s response to the coronavirus, despite the strong backing in opinion surveys for the prime minister’s performance.The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick on Monday backed a proposal for more frequent sittings, with the government and opposition able to suspend the schedule for public health reasons.The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, told reporters in Sydney there was a “high likelihood” the proposed committee would be created with the backing of Labor, Centre Alliance, the Greens and Lambie.Burke said the committee is an “important” development but “it doesn’t of itself though override the importance of parliament meeting”.He accused Porter of “ridiculing the importance” of his own job, and noted that when parliament last sat it had not been characterised by Labor “sledges” but “questions of detail that the Australian people wanted answers for”.“At the moment, you’ve got parliament behaving at its best. And the government’s response is they’d rather not have parliament,” he said.The protest will contrast with Labor’s support for changes to the Fair Work Act intended to efficiently distribute the $130bn jobkeeper payments.The opposition will argue for the payments to go to a wider group of casual workers but is expected to accept the government’s final decision.It will be the first sitting of parliament since 23 March and MPs are not expected to be summoned back until 11 August.Parliaments have closed down around the country. The NSW parliament last sat on 24 March and is not scheduled to meet again until September. Tasmania’s last met on 26 March and is not expected to return until August.The chambers of Queensland (18 March) and Victoria (19 March), the Northern Territory (24 March) and the ACT (2 April) have no scheduled return date.The parliaments of South Australia and Western Australia are still operating."

How music has fought pandemics for 2,700 years ","Disease is on the prowl. As residents hide behind locked doors, barely a footstep is heard on Milan’s cobbled streets. A strict quarantine is in effect, and all commerce, trade and public life have vanished. The area around Il Duomo, the city’s ornate cathedral, stands empty.Fearing contagion, all religious gatherings have been banned. But when it comes to their faith – and, importantly, their music – nothing can stand in the people’s way. Following a call to “go to church in spirit”, they launch a collective act of social and musical defiance. Windows are opened, doors unlocked and balconies perched on as thousands of men, women and children start to sing.No, this is not Milan during the coronavirus lockdown. It’s the summer of 1576, and the plague of Saint Charles has devastated much of the Italian north.“It was a sight to see,” one commentator reported, “when all the inhabitants of this populous city, numbering little short of 300,000 souls … [sent] up together an harmonious voice.” It was such a sight, he wrote, that Milan appeared as “the heavenly Jerusalem” itself.“Just think, in walking around Milan, one heard nothing but song,” another remarked wistfully. “One almost wished for these tribulations to last longer.”The parallels to the current pandemic are striking. People in Italy, Spain and the wider world have used music to bring their communities together on a truly impressive scale: videos of balcony concerts – in which quarantined musicians perform for other nearby residents – are going viral, and covers of Nessun Dorma, Valerie, Imagine and even a spirited run-through of Lewis Capaldi’s Someone You Loved have emerged.In a poignant echo to the plague of St Charles, one Milanese trumpeter offered his soulful rendition of O Mia Bela Madunina, the city’s hymn to the golden Virgin Mary atop Il Duomo. The UK’s recent Clap for the NHS is another example. In that case, it didn’t matter if you were a musician: pots, pans, hands and shouts were enough.Such gestures of communality offer us much-needed consolation. But in the broader landscape of history, it would be an anomaly if we weren’t playing music in this way.From as early as ancient Egypt, Greece and the Babylonians, music has been a reliable tool for spiritual healing and social bonding for thousands of years amid disease. When plague struck Sparta in the 7th century BC, city leaders petitioned the poet Thaletus to sing hymns, and Terpander, another noted ancient Greek poet, was called up during a plague in Lesbos. Even Pythagoras, the creator of every schoolchild’s favourite theorem, used music as a therapeutic device, playing the lyre to calm drunken hooligans.In medieval Italy, music went far beyond singing from windows, too. Before knowledge of contagion was widespread, the medieval “plague procession” was a recurrent sight on Europe’s streets. Entire towns marched, sang and prayed under icons of local saints, with call-and-response litanies designed to encourage participation. Remi Chiu, a musicologist at Loyola University, finds a parallel in these processions with the “Wuhan jiayou!” – or ‘Stay strong, Wuhan!” – chants that took off in January in the Chinese city where the pandemic began and likewise with the appearance of local patriotic songs on Italian balconies.Chiu says music’s ability to overcome our egos is a “very powerful” tool in a quarantine. “When you’re making music, you’re submitting yourself – your mind, your body – to its regulation. And when you’re making music communally, or even dancing or doing the Macarena with your neighbours, you’re simultaneously contributing and submitting yourself to the larger goal of the group.” Technology can extend this communality – through a tweet or Facebook post, what would have become a column inch or a forgotten memory can inspire global solidarity.Religion is playing a far less tangible role today than it did in medieval Italy. While the importance of religion varies from country to country and city to city, that Lewis Capaldi appears at all in our musical response is a significant development. Religion can be a very strong social glue in localised groups, but non-religious music may encounter fewer obstacles in our collective identity politics: if you like Céline Dion, it doesn’t matter if you’re Catholic, Jewish, Protestant or Jedi.Plus, even in the climate of medieval Europe, religious fanatics were known to take things too far. The “flagellants” found the source of disease in their own sinfulness, and responded in kind through vivid displays of violent masochism. With music again as a driving pulse, flagellants would whip their backs with chains and ropes for hours on end, and to the singular horror of most who saw them.Social bonds aren’t the beginning and end of music, either. In our response to the coronavirus, balcony concerts have been just one of a range of musical tools we’ve deployed. Virtual gigs, “pandemic pop” and a corona-themed Bono single have so far appeared, but music’s role can be considerably more basic. So long as we use any kind of music to restore balance and reduce our suffering, we’ll be walking in the footsteps of our forebears.Viewing our minds and bodies as intrinsically connected, medicine since the time of ancient Greece has claimed that maintaining a positive state of mind can offer the conjoining effect of treating physical disease. During the Renaissance, patients were encouraged to compose and study art, joke and laugh with their friends, and also to play music, because the resulting energy would flow favourably to their “humours”: ethereal substances believed to form the building blocks of our constitutions.Indeed, when plague approached England, it’s no coincidence that Henry VIII chose his organ player as one of the five men he quarantined with; Boccaccio’s Decameron, now a classic of historical fiction, describes a circle of Italian aristocrats who retreat from a mainland plague for days of sex, music and drinking. And as Dr Chris Macklin, a former professor of musicology at Mercer University and an authority on plague music, notes in a blog post, the 14th-century composer Guillaume de Machaut was deeply troubled by the Black Death but none of his music referenced it. Why? “Music is a science which asks that one laugh, and sing, and dance,” he wrote. “It does not care for melancholy, nor for the man who is melancholy.”Talk of “humours” may seem fanciful now, of course. But this is no reason to do away with the music. “Music is proving to be a true antidote to fear, just as Renaissance doctors claimed,” says Chiu. For patients with schizophrenia, cancer, multiple sclerosis and others – and even those on ventilators – music therapy can significantly reduce in anxiety, depression and sometimes the underlying symptoms of disease.Macklin writes that “music was not a luxury in times of epidemic uncertainty – it was a necessity”. Now that we’re equipped with technology, science and a global identity, music may be more valuable – and more necessary – than ever."
"185","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/matt-hancock-biotech-germany-coronavirus-health-system","2020-04-06T03:00:50-0400","  
 No, Matt Hancock: biotech giants are not behind Germany's coronavirus success ","When Olfert Landt first heard about a novel virus ravaging parts of China, he sprung into action, and by the 10 January, according to Bloomberg, the microbiologist, working with researchers at Berlin’s Charité hospital, had developed a viable test for the disease.TIB Molbiol Syntheselabor GmbH, the small company Landt leads, had produced more than 4 million tests by 12March. It’s the kind of story that has fuelled claims that Germany’s strong biotech industry has provided the country with a unique advantage in combating the coronavirus. Donald Trump retweeted the Bloomberg story about Landt. The UK’s health minister, Matt Hancock, who held his first press conference on Thursday after recovering from coronavirus himself, didn’t mention Landt, but he was quick to point to the strength of the German pharmaceutical industry as the primary reason for the country’s aggressive testing regime and low death rate: “My German counterpart, for instance,” Hancock said, “could call upon 100 test labs ready and waiting when the crisis stuck, thanks in large part to Roche, one of the biggest diagnostic companies in the world.”It’s easy to understand why the UK, in particular, is feeling defensive: while Germany has tested nearly a million samples for Covid-19, the UK, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, has tested just 152,979 people for the Corona virus according to the Department of Health and Social Care has tested just 195,524 people up until yesterday morning.But Hancock’s attempt to attribute Germany’s success to a strong biotech sector rings false. The four million tests produced by Landt’s company have been distributed throughout the world. Indeed, the biochemist told Deutsche Welle that he would like to start delivering tests to Russia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Iran – countries that are currently under embargo. For all its might in the industry, Germany’s output is dwarfed by the scale of the US pharmaceutical industry: Germany captured 4.01% of global pharmaceutical sales in 2016, whereas the US controlled 44.45% of the market in the same year, and the UK captured 2.35%. Indeed, Hoffmann-La Roche, the company to which Hancock seems to have attributed the strength of the German testing infrastructure, is Swiss, not German.Hancock’s errors disguise inconvenient truths about the German situation. Though Roche has developed tests and manufactures equipment, it is laboratories at universities, hospitals and government agencies that have taken the lead in testing for Covid-19 in Germany. Private laboratories have played a crucial role in Germany’s testing regime, but big business has not; according to statistics compiled by Akkredierte Labore in der Medizin, a trade group for the medical diagnostics industry, the six largest private providers of Covid-19 tests together account for 36% of the laboratories currently testing in Germany. Indeed, the distributed nature of the German response can be seen in the rapid increase in the number of facilities doing testing. Between 2 and 8 March, 43 laboratories conducted 36,067 tests. Last week, 97 laboratories conducted 313,957 tests.It isn’t an accident that, unlike the UK, Germany has had such success in engaging a wide network of laboratories to conduct Covid-19 testing. The country’s federal system has long assigned the national government to a coordinating role, and regional autonomy over large parts of the healthcare system may have helped to create more resilient systems, better able to coordinate the work of different laboratories.Even as the country’s more distributed healthcare system has helped to spread the burden of testing more evenly, a strong bureaucratic state has stepped in to help coordinate testing, containment and treatment efforts. In Bavaria, teachers and other furloughed state employees have been reassigned to service at the health departments, where they help to coordinate the logistics of the response.Despite the success of Germany’s response to the pandemic so far, many voices in the country have called for caution. The virus seems to have gained a foothold relatively late here, which has allowed for a more coordinated response than would have been possible in Italy or China. Even so, and despite aggressive testing, it is still entirely possible that the number of cases will spike, overwhelming the healthcare system and leading to much higher mortality.Still, if current trends continue, Germany will have shown itself to be uniquely capable among western nations of dealing with a global pandemic. The huge number of tests and its low mortality rate can be attributed to a number of different factors –  the relative youth of many people infected by the virus and potential underreporting especially – but the country’s proximity to a major Swiss biotech firm is very low among them indeed. If Hancock insists on reducing the success of the German response to a single factor, he would do far better to look at continued investment into the country’s health system. Germany has more hospital beds per person than anywhere else in Europe – 8.1 per 1000 inhabitants, compared with 3.2 in Italy, 2.8 in the US, and 2.6 in the UK. These hospitals host some of the testing facilities that have enabled Germany to respond to the crisis so aggressively. For now, they also have the capacity to treat patients from France and Italy while other healthcare systems collapse under the strain of the pandemic.• Peter Kuras is a writer and translator based in Berlin"

Finley’s grandparents later found her dead in her apartment. She was 53.Finley did not die as a result of Covid-19. She died in 2016 as a result of America’s healthcare system – a system that led her to avoid treatment for the common flu in order to avoid debt. It is that same system that is currently creaking under the pressure of a pandemic that experts warned was coming but governments failed to prepare for. It is a system that does not qualify for the term “developed”.The United States of America, we are told by everyone from the president to the United Nations, is a developed economy. That term, “developed economy”, sounds like an endpoint, like man standing upright after a series of hunched and hairy iterations. It’s the contrast that makes the definition – developed economies can only really exist if they are compared to their poorer “developing” counterparts. Covid-19 has merely shown the cracks in a very successful marketing campaign about which category the US falls into.There are 2.9 hospital beds for every 1,000 people in the United States. That’s fewer than Turkmenistan (7.4 beds per 1,000), Mongolia (7.0), Argentina (5.0) and Libya (3.7). In fact, the US ranks 69th out of 182 countries analyzed by the World Health Organization. This lack of hospital beds is forcing doctors across the country to ration care under Covid-19, pushing up the number of preventable deaths.America’s numbers are similarly unimpressive when it comes to medical doctors. The United States has 2.6 doctors per 1,000 people, placing it behind Trinidad & Tobago (2.7), and Russia (4.0 doctors per 1,000, for a country that is described as being “in transition”). Life expectancies at birth are lower in the US than they are in Chile or China. The US has a higher maternal mortality rate than Iran or Saudi Arabia.It’s not just health. Access to the internet is better in Bahrain and Brunei (two countries the UN does not consider developed economies) than it is in the US. Inequality scores are higher in America than they are in Mali and Yemen. A closer country to America in inequality is Israel, a country which functions as an apartheid state.And the US ranks 81st in the world in terms of women’s political representation. So, you’ve got a better chance of making it into office as a woman if you live in Vietnam, or Albania. Sub-Saharan Africa is most comparable to America - 24% of seats in the region’s parliaments are held by women, the same figure as in the US.In the United States, 83% of students graduate high school. That figure is higher in Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Barbados, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Montenegro. None of those countries are considered “developed economies” by the United Nations.So why does the United Nations consider the US as a developed economy when its own statistics so clearly suggest otherwise? One might argue that it’s about simple wealth, or gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of the economy, per capita.But if that were the measure of development then European countries such as Romania, Hungary and Slovakia should not qualify for the term “developed economy” while Bermuda, Qatar, Singapore and China should all make the list. Besides, GDP per capita is no reliable measure of wellbeing in a country like the US where the richest 5% of people own two-thirds of the national wealth.The facts are as exhaustive as they are exhausting. There’s one simple conclusion from all of this. We’ve been tricked. We’ve been told that America, like most other majority-white countries, deserves the title “developed economy”. It does not. You can not charge a woman $39.95 to hold the baby that she has just given birth to. You can not constantly operate hospitals at close to capacity in order to maximize profits. The pursuit of private money in systems built for public good has not worked ethically or practically.Why does it matter whether a country is defined as developing or not? Because it means that policymakers here can distract voters into thinking that crises are constantly diplomatic, military or trade based when actually the problems that America needs to fix most urgently are right here – they’re the crises of health and education. Had those problems been better addressed, the nation would not be struggling as desperately as it is right now."

This will apply to all registered charities, including those with a turnover of more than $1b.The changes ease eligibility for not-for-profit services including childcare centres, and raised the hopes of the university sector they would also benefit.But on Monday the assistant charities minister, Zed Seselja, clarified that non-government schools and universities will have to meet the higher threshold of a 30% downturn.Porter told reporters in Canberra the changes showed the government had “tried to be as inclusive as possible” but when it came to shorter term casuals missing out “there have to be some definitions and some lines drawn”.Asked to confirm the government will not extend eligibility, Porter replied that the definition of “systemic and regular employment with the same employer for a 12-month period” is in the Fair Work Act. “That’s the definition.”Porter suggested casuals who miss out may not be much worse off because there is “going to be an equivalence between a casual worker who would receive jobkeeper … and someone who would have to go on to the jobseeker payment but also has the capacity to pick up work as well”.Porter said that some businesses “on the edge of viability can only afford to pay a worker the $1,500 jobkeeper amount”.“So the structural problem that the legislation needs to deal with … [is that] unless we change the Fair Work Act, we cannot guarantee that a worker can lawfully work the right amount of hours for the $1,500 payment.”The government’s bill, seen by the ACTU and soon to be sent to Labor ahead of debate and a vote on Wednesday, rectifies the situation by allowing employers to vary their employees’ hours up or down to the number covered by the $1,500 at the regular rate of pay.Porter argued the alternative, changing 120 modern awards, would take “weeks if not months” to complete – although unions dispute this, citing the fact employers have nominated just 15 awards that must urgently change in their negotiations.“I’ve described it as $130bn worth of lifeboats going out,” Porter said. “This is parliament’s Dunkirk moment. We get the lifeboats out, and we save jobs, and we do it in the simplest, clearest guaranteed formula that parliament can devise.”Dominique Lamb, the National Retail Association chief executive officer, told Guardian Australia she supports unions’ push to expand eligibility because “if you’re in employment you should be eligible for jobkeeper”.Lamb said the retail industry is diverse, with many entering the workforce without English as a first language, and her members had concerns that there was no safety net for temporary visa holders, many of whom had families that were not eligible for any type of welfare.In addition to expanding eligibility to shorter term casuals and temporary visa-holders, Labor would prefer changes be implemented to awards rather than the Fair Work Act, to accommodate union concerns that employers not experiencing financial distress would seek to benefit by forcing workers to run down their leave and cutting their hours.But on Monday the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, conceded he could not imagine any circumstances under which Labor would oppose the bill.Burke told reporters in Sydney that the Fair Work Commission could move at “lightning speed” and the changes to hours would be “simple and fast” in most awards, while avoiding the “unintended consequences” of legislative change.For example, Burke suggested the system could be open to “abuses” such as an employer directing an employee whose regular hours did not amount to $1,500 in pay to then cook and clean at the employer’s home.Burke – who has identified that millions of workers could be left without leave due to a loophole in jobkeeper – warned the payment was “meant to be a wage subsidy” but on current drafting employers could “take it for themselves” by using it to pay down accrued leave entitlements.Earlier, Porter sought to allay concern about the legislation, insisting the changes will only last for six months.He also pointed to a “secondary requirement about the viability of the business, and the necessity to give a direction around hours worked to save the job of the employee in question”.Porter said the Fair Work Commission would be able to review an employer direction “so that there will be safeguards in the process of trying to make the hours match the $1,500 payments”.Childcare centres, non-government schools and private educational providers have emerged as potential winners from eligibility changes for charities.Goodstart Early Learning said it was “very relieved” to learn that it was now eligible to apply for the $1,500 per fortnight subsidy for its staff.“Access to the jobkeeper payments is vital as it will ensure that we can trade through this very difficult time,” the chief executive, Julia Davison, said in a statement.Seselja said the “15% decline in the turnover threshold is aimed at charities like the Salvation Army and Catholic Social Services Australia”.“Non-government schools and universities are eligible for the jobkeeper payment.“However, they will need to meet the turnover threshold of 30% for those with an annual turnover of less than $1 billion.”"

It’s going to be our 9/11 moment,” Jerome Adams told NBC News’ Meet the Press.“It’s going to be the hardest moment for many Americans in their entire lives, and we really need to understand that if we want to flatten that curve and get through to the other side, everyone needs to do their part.”Adams’s thoughts were echoed by Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s foremost infectious diseases expert, in a White House briefing on Sunday. “This is probably going to be a very bad week,” Fauci said.Donald Trump echoed similar language from the White House briefing room on Sunday, saying that the coming week would be difficult. The president said, however, there’s “a light at the end of the tunnel”.“We are feeling confident in the days ahead America will endure the peak of this terrible pandemic,” he said. “Our warriors in this life and death battle are the incredible doctors and nurses and health care workers on the frontline of the fight.”In Sunday’s press conference, Trump also repeatedly encouraged Americans to try hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus, despite a lack of scientific evidence to support the use of the anti-malaria drug as a possible remedy for Covid-19. Trump said his administration has ordered 29m doses to be distributed across the United States, and later on prevented Fauci from answering a question on the efficacy of the treatment from the White House podium.Trump also said in the conference that Fema is airlifting supplies to affected states, including millions of masks, gloves, and sterile gowns.He also took the opportunity to take digs at the governor of Illinois, CNN and a reporter from the Associated Press, calling CNN “fake news” for asking about the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and scolding the AP reporter for asking “wise guy questions”.﻿The US had recorded nearly 331,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 9,500 deaths by Sunday evening, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.New York state, the worst hit by far, recorded 594 deaths on Saturday – down from 630 deaths the day before, the first day-on-day decrease since the pandemic took off.“The apex could be a plateau, and we could be on that plateau now,” New York governor Andrew Cuomo said, adding that the coming days would make clear which direction the state was headed. Overall 4,159 New Yorkers have died and there have been 122,031 confirmed cases, Cuomo said.From Louisiana, a developing hotspot, Governor John Bel Edwards reiterated that his state was projected to run out of ventilators by Thursday and would reach intensive-care capacity two days after that.As of Sunday, 477 people had died from Covid-19 in Louisiana, with well over half in the New Orleans metro area. New Orleans now has the highest per capita death rate of any city in the US, according to data analysis by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.“This is a tough emergency and it’s not different here than it is elsewhere,” Edwards told CNN’s State of the Union, confirming that 200 ventilators had arrived from the national stockpile on Saturday.On Monday, Louisiana will open its first makeshift field hospital, at the Morial Convention Center in New Orleans. It will house 1,000 beds and, like other temporary sites in New York and elsewhere, is designed to ease the burden on city hospitals.Senior infectious disease doctors, speaking to the Guardian last week, confirmed that hospitals in New Orleans have begun discussing the ethics of how to ration care should they become overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients.As the crisis accelerates, five states have declined to issue stay-at-home orders: Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Arkansas. All have Republican governors.On Sunday, Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson said there was no point issuing such an order because it would be ignored. “You have a stay-at-home order, tomorrow 600,000 Arkansans will still go to work,” Hutchinson said on NBC.Fauci said states without stay-at-home orders were “putting themselves at risk”.“I will not say we have it under control, that would be a false statement,” Fauci told CBS’s Face the Nation. “We are struggling to get it under control, and that’s the issue that’s at hand right now.” He said the rate of increase in new cases was slowing, an encouraging sign.Adams, the surgeon general, urged people to stay at home no matter what rules are in place in their state.“Ninety percent of Americans are doing their part, even in the states where they haven’t had a shelter in place [order],” Adams said. “But if you can’t give us 30 days, governors, give us a week, give us what you can, so that we don’t overwhelm our healthcare systems over this next week. And then let’s reassess at that point.”Reaching again for imagery from the second world war, he added: “We want everyone to understand you’ve got to be Rosie the Riveter. You’ve got to do your part.”Adams also advised people to wear masks or otherwise cover their mouths and noses when out in public, in addition to staying six feet apart.“You need to make sure you’re not substituting social distancing with face masks,” he said.Trump, 73, said again on Sunday in the press conference he would not wear a mask despite such federal guidelines. “I’m not going to wear one,” he said. “I would wear it if I thought it was important.”His prospective opponent in the November election, Joe Biden, 77, said on Sunday he would wear a mask if he left his home in Wilmington, Delaware.“Look, I think it’s important to follow the science, listen to the experts, do what they tell you,” Biden said. “[Trump] may not like how he looks in a mask but the truth of the matter is that – follow the science. That’s what they’re telling us.”"

The advice is to stay home, rest and take paracetamol. In 80% of cases, that is the end of it.But NHS advice is that if the symptoms – mainly the dry cough, temperature and fatigue – have not gone by the end of a week, or they get worse, people should seek medical help.Unlike Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who revealed he had Covid-19 on the same day as the prime minister, Boris Johnson has not recovered within the first week. He is said to have been admitted to hospital for tests, which may include scans of his lungs to check for pneumonia, as well as blood tests. He had a diagnostic test for Covid-19, so doctors will be looking for progression of the disease and to establish that he has not entered the second phase, where the immune system goes into overdrive.Given the increasing pressure on hospitals at the moment, it is unlikely he will have been admitted unless doctors have real concerns. Minor tests could be carried out in Downing Street.Early guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) suggest the following symptoms may help a doctor to decide whether a patient with Covid-19 should go to hospital:Severe shortness of breath at rest or difficulty breathing.Coughing up blood.Blue lips or face.Feeling cold and clammy with pale or mottled skin.Collapse or fainting (syncope).New confusion.Becoming difficult to rouse.Little or no urine output.In the first week, people who are fit and healthy, with a robust immune system, will usually fight off the virus. But the problems come for some people in the second week, when their immune system overreacts to the virus and ends up attacking the body’s own organs. That is why the most seriously ill can end up on life support machines with organ failure.Chinese data showed that 20% of patients went to hospital. Some 15% had severe disease, which involved breathing difficulties and hypoxia, where some of the tissues of the body are not getting an adequate oxygen supply. That can manifest in anxiety, confusion and restlessness.Only 5% ended up in critical care, with such severe illness that they needed organ support. Ventilators can take over the patient’s breathing, to allow the lungs time to recover. But patients could also need support for their heart, liver and kidneys – although many of those needing that sort of mechanical help have underlying conditions which make them particularly vulnerable."

What do you have to lose?” Trump said on Saturday, suggesting he might do so himself after asking “my doctors”.On Sunday, Trump said America doesn’t have time “to take a couple years” to test the efficacy of the drug in treating Covid-19.But Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top doctor on infectious diseases and a key member of the White House taskforce, was adamant there was nothing to suggest the medicine had any benefit against coronavirus.“In terms of science, I don’t think we can definitively say it works,” he told CBS’s Face the Nation.“The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there’s no effect.”Dr James Phillips, professor of emergency medicine at George Washington University hospital, said Americans could be risking their health if they followed the president’s advice to take a drug for a condition for which it had not been tested.“We don’t know enough to make medical recommendations,” he told CNN’s Reliable Sources.“It’s a dangerous message for someone without a medical license to get up there and tell people to try it. You need to listen to physicians, people who understand science, before you go willy-nilly into the medicine cabinet.”Fauci has been reluctant to directly criticise the president, with whom he speaks regularly, but has found himself repeatedly having to contradict the president over hydroxychloroquine, which has become a hobby horse at White House briefings.On 21 March, the day after another nationally televised Trump claim that the drug “looked promising”, Fauci was asked directly if it could be used to treat Covid-19.“The answer is no,” he said.Last month, a man in Arizona died after he and his wife took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is also found in hydroxychloroquine.“Trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,” the man’s wife told NBC.According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, by Sunday lunchtime about 313,000 cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed in the US and more than 8,500 people had died.Fauci did concur with White House messaging that a grim period lies ahead in the battle against the virus, and that the US is “struggling” to control the pandemic.“This is going to be a bad week, unfortunately,” he said. “We need to be prepared that even though it’s clear mitigation is working, we’re still going to see … deaths.”Fauci said there were glimmers of hope, but not things were due to get worse first.“We should hope that within a week, maybe a little bit more, we’ll start to see a flattening out of the curve, and it coming down,” he said. “But the end result of that you don’t see for days, if not weeks down the pipe. Things are going to get bad and we need to prepare for that, it is going to be shocking to some.“I will not say we have it under control, that would be a false statement, we are struggling to get it under control.”Even after the crisis was over, Fauci warned, the possibility of a resurgence remained.“Unless we get this globally under control, there’s a very good chance it will assume a seasonal nature. It will unlikely be completely eradicated from the planet,” he said.“That’s why we’re pushing so hard on getting our preparedness much better, pushing on a vaccine and doing clinical trials for therapeutic interventions so that hopefully if we do see that resurgence we will have interventions we did not have at the beginning of the situation we’re in right now.”"

The first animal started showing symptoms on 27 March, and all were doing well and expected to recover, said the zoo, which has been closed to the public since 16 March amid the outbreak.“These are extremely hard days for all of us – no matter where we live and work. We will ensure that whatever we can learn from these circumstances will be used to better understand and combat this disease,” the zoo’s director, Jim Breheny, said in a statement.The finding raises new questions about transmission of the virus in animals. The US Department of Agriculture, which confirmed Nadia’s test result at its veterinary lab, said there were no known cases of the virus in US pets or livestock.“There doesn’t appear to be, at this time, any evidence that suggests that the animals can spread the virus to people or that they can be a source of the infection in the United States,” Dr Jane Rooney, a veterinarian and a USDA official, said in an interview.The USDA said on Sunday it was not recommending routine coronavirus testing of animals, in zoos or elsewhere, or of zoo employees. Still, Rooney said a small number of animals in the US had been tested through the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories, and all those tests came back negative except Nadia’s.The coronavirus outbreaks around the world are driven by person-to-person transmission, experts say.There have been a handful of reports outside the US of pet dogs or cats becoming infected after close contact with contagious people, including a Hong Kong dog that tested positive for a low level of the pathogen in February and early March. Hong Kong agriculture authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn’t pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners.Some researchers have been trying to understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the virus, and to determine how it spreads among animals, according to the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health.The American Veterinary Medical Association and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been recommending that out of an abundance of caution, people ill with the coronavirus should limit contact with animals – advice that the veterinary group reiterated after learning of the tiger’s test result.In general, the CDC also advises people to wash their hands after handling animals and do other things to keep pets and their homes clean.At the Bronx zoo, Nadia, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions developed dry coughs, and some of the cats exhibited some wheezing and loss of appetite, said Dr Paul Calle, the zoo’s chief veterinarian. He said the zoo conducted the coronavirus test to be thorough.Only Nadia was tested because it takes anaesthesia to get a sample from a big cat. Her temperature was taken at the same time, and it was normal, Calle said.The seven sickened cats live in two areas at the zoo, and the animals had contact with the same worker, who was doing OK, zoo officials said. They said they were taking “appropriate preventive measures” for the staffers that care for the ailing animals, and there are no signs of illness in other big cats on the property.Nearly 10,000 Americans have died in the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 335,000 infected. New York has been the worst affected state."

","I work in a supported housing service in London. We work with homeless people with complex needs including drug and alcohol addiction, mental health issues and mobility problems. Some have been evicted from services multiple times because they are too difficult to look after, or broke the rules.The first thing I do on Monday morning is read the weekend handover. The police came to view CCTV after a former resident smashed the security door.We’re five staff down because of coronavirus. Two are off indefinitely, our team leader is working from home, one is self-isolating for 14 days and we’ve lost a bank worker.Before my shift I drive around all the supermarkets to see if there’s anything left. I find two packets of pasta, but we’ve got 60 residents and it’s becoming a struggle to feed them.We get a food donation from Meat Liquor so I drive to Dulwich to pick it up and then head back to help staff prepare lunch.I try to find cleaning products. The staff and some of the residents are worried about coronavirus. I have to keep reassuring them that we have everything in place to keep them safe.A local grocery shop has a stock of plastic gloves and hand wash, and they let me buy extra for the services. We get a large donation from Greggs, a lot of it is sugary stuff and biscuits rather than nutritious food but it makes our residents happy.I try to encourage a resident with cancer to go to the local A&E as he’s come out in bruises all over his body, but he’s afraid. I get a call from a consultant at King’s College hospital and he says it sounds like his liver is failing. The resident refuses to go to hospital. I decide to keep an eye on him but I’m worried because he’s also lost his appetite.I put up signs around the service highlighting the importance of social distancing, then I cook lunch for all the residents. We’re short-staffed but we all get on with it as best we can. The minimum the service can run with is three members of staff.As I leave I find a group of eight of our residents on the corner. I pull over the car to remind them about the importance of social distancing. They say they’re fine, that they live together so it doesn’t count. It’s not until I tell them the police will stop and search them that they move on.Half our residents are really nervous and wearing gloves and masks, and the other half are hugging, coming up close to staff, and coughing, not aware how scary it can be for everyone else.I try to convince the resident with cancer to go to hospital. I tell him I’ll sit on his bed all night if he doesn’t go; he gives in after five or six hours and lets us call an ambulance. I’m surprised how quickly it comes.I go to a local pharmacy to get three thermometers for three of our services but they’ll only let me buy two. I try to explain why we need them, that it’s justified by the nature of our work, but they refuse. A kind man behind me in the queue buys me the third. I’m so grateful I feel like hugging him but then I remember about social distancing.Another resident receives her benefits and buys herself heroin and crack. She returns and passes out. I pick her up off the floor and then all the staff have to check her vital signs throughout the night. Social distancing goes out the window. I’m there three hours after my shift ends and then I’m on call.This has been the toughest day so far. I’m already thinking about who we’ll lose because of underlying health issues. It’s difficult to keep all 60 safe.Denell Dema works for Evolve Housing + Support in a supported housing service in south London.If you would like to contribute to our My working week series about your job in public services, get in touch by emailing sarah.johnson@theguardian.com"

Yesterday I needed to get some food but all my money is stuck in online banking apps and all the cashpoints are closed. I managed to borrow some from a friend, otherwise I would have been in big trouble.”Local government official Rubayet Hayat, of the sub-district of Goalanda, said food and financial aid from the disaster management and relief ministry would start to be distributed by the end of this week.“There are some 1,800 women in the brothels under our jurisdiction. We have asked for 30kgs of rice and 2,000 taka (£20) [for each of these women],” he said. “We have got the initial approval and are hoping the funds will be sanctioned by the end of this week.”Healthcare workers at a charity hospital near to the brothel in Goalanda said more help would be needed to prevent an outbreak of Covid-19 in brothels and red light districts.“The brothel area is very dirty and unhygienic. The rooms are inhumanly tiny. The house owners built the rooms strategically for more profit so that they can fit more rooms in a small area,” said Zulfekar Ali, the in-charge doctor at the Gonoshasthaya Kendra charity hospital. “In that same tiny room, the sex workers live, work and often cook. Many share common toilets.”He added that many women working in the brothels are often reluctant to access healthcare services because they fear being shamed and stigmatised. “We are using loud hailers to spread awareness in the brothels, telling the women who are there to wash their hands properly,” he said."

I also receive personal independence payments because I have to wear a rigid back brace due to 11 vertebral compression fractures. I live on my own in a rural location.I have had delivery passes for Sainsbury’s home delivery for the last six years but their website will not let me book a delivery as their system states that I am not a vulnerable customer. According to its website, my 85-year-old mother who lives on her own and has dementia is also not a vulnerable customer. When I ring the helpline it is either engaged or there is a message and then I get cut off.I really need help getting food delivered in the next 12 weeks and don’t seem to be able to even talk to any member of staff at Sainsbury’s. Please can someone help to get them to acknowledge my status?AK, Penzance, CornwallAs a vulnerable woman aged 78 with multiple disabilities I have been trying for a week now to inform Sainsbury’s of my situation in order to get my regular online shopping given priority. The website is useless and the telephone help centre is permanently engaged.My disabilities include type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and asthma. I have no help whatsoever and have been online grocery shopping for some time now.On 17 March I started trying to inform them of my situation. At that stage each day I hung on for periods ranging from 30 minutes to an hour and three-quarters. Finally on the Saturday I spoke to a man who assured me a form to fill in would be online on the Monday. No such thing has appeared and telephone lines are now permanently engaged.With the latest government advice to stay at home and unable to contact Sainsbury’s, I am at my wits’ end. Please can you help? MR, Chelmsford, EssexThe coronavirus outbreak and government advice on self-isolation and the need to stay at home has inevitably led to all supermarket delivery services (which typically account for only 7% of supermarket sales but which have since soared to 20%) struggling to meet demand.We know retailers are buckling under the strain but what has not helped has been little clarity about the definition of who is deemed to be vulnerable. The problem is that while you, AK, appear to be among the 1.5 million most vulnerable identified by the government, you still struggled to get your delivery. Amazingly, MR does not seem to qualify. In addition to correspondence via this column from other readers unable to get their deliveries, the Guardian’s switchboard has been swamped with calls on the same problem.We contacted Sainsbury’s, which agreed to escalate both your cases. You have subsequently managed to book slots – and another for AK’s mother – with, we understand, all three deliveries successfully made.The retailer apologised to you both for the inconvenience caused by the long wait times and said: “We are doing our absolute best to offer online delivery slots to elderly and vulnerable customers. Elderly and vulnerable customers have priority over all slots. We have proactively contacted 270,000 customers who had already given us information that meant we could identify them as elderly or vulnerable. Our customer careline is working at full capacity to help other vulnerable customers and we are able to give an additional 8,000 customers a day access to delivery slots over the phone. We have already booked in slots for 115,000 elderly and vulnerable customers this week and this number is growing every day.“We will (shortly) receive the government database which tells us which people the government considers to be most vulnerable. Where these people are registered with us, we will start to write to them next week to offer them a delivery slot.”It later added: “MR and AK have both been added to our vulnerable customer list and received priority delivery slots.”Sainsbury’s is also prioritising elderly and vulnerable customers with its click-and-collect service, which is also busy.In response, AK told us: “Thank you so much for all your help, which has given me the best possible result and has made my birthday a much happier day today.” MR said: “Delivery arrived with very knowledgable driver. Sainsbury’s should be asking them for their opinions as they get to know their customers very well.”"

Experts have consistently warned against over-reliance on modelling or viewing it as predictive.The government has unleashed a raft of spending measures to prop up the economy while businesses go into “hibernation”, including $130bn for wage subsidies over the next six months and $1.6bn for free childcare over three months, but has emphasised that the expenditure will have to be reined in down the track.Some within the government worry there is a point at which imposing stringent restrictions for an extended period might prompt people to flout the social distancing rules while putting additional strain on the nation’s finances. In general, the states and territories have leaned towards moving to tougher restrictions sooner, in a bid to prevent the health system from being overrun with cases.The prime minister acknowledged at a press conference last week that Australians were “making big sacrifices” and wanted to know what they were achieving, so the government would share more information about its goals, including intensive care unit targets. Morrison said the national cabinet would keep track of relevant data as it moved into what he called the “suppression phase”.The outlook predicted by the Sydney University simulation is based on a 90% compliance with social distancing rules.It assumes the incidence peak — the number of new cases reported daily — was hit in late March, and a prevalence peak — the number of cases active at once — in mid-April. Under this scenario the total number of cases in Australia will reach between 8,000 and 10,000. As of Monday, the actual numbers show 5,744 cases.“The incidence peak is fairly clear,” he said. “It has fallen and if nothing outrageous happens again, like an outbreak or a new cruise ship disaster, it will continue going down.”If Australians use the cautious optimism of health experts that the epidemic curve is beginning to flatten in Australia as an excuse to relax the rules constricting their daily lives, that outlook changes. An 80% compliance with social distancing would see the number of cases decline, but at a slower rate, and a 70% compliance would see the number of cases continue to rise.The modelling is produced by a simulation designed as a “digital twin of Australia”, with 24 million individual agents with unique characteristics based on census data, school attendance, geographical distribution and other population inputs, as well as epidemiological characteristics of Covid-19.Built into the simulation is the assumption that only 67% of all adults with the virus and 13% of all children with the virus are symptomatic, a detail that Prokopenko said is one of the “strongest parts of the model”.That simulation was used to run scenarios assuming different levels of compliance with self-isolation and social distancing polices, which were then compared with the actual case reports in Australia.“As it so happens, from 24 March it looks like the most correct one is the model that assumes 90% compliance,” he said.They also modelled what would happen if social distancing measures were relaxed.“Even if you stayed for 90 days with that 90% compliance and then relaxed it all at once, it will shoot up,” he said.“The task is bringing this to zero. Not five, not one, to zero. Because if you still have one remaining case, that one remaining case will go to two the next day, to four the next, and then you get exponential growth.”Prokopenko suggested that strict social distancing measures would need to remain in place for four weeks after the last known case recovered, to prevent silent spread through asymptomatic cases. And, when social distancing measures are gradually relaxed, Australia would need to follow China in conducting widespread testing and contact tracing to ensure any asymptomatic cases are detected and contained.“This resurgence is not unavoidable,” he said. “It’s avoidable with some vigilance.”"

The video suggested some stores would have markings on the ground directing people where to stand while queuing in order to properly space out the line. A spokesperson said in-store security would help maintain physical distancing.Woolworths said that they would “work closely with local centre management security and police to help manage queues outside the store at peak times to ensure customers are keeping at least 1.5 meters apart from each other.”Similar rules have already been introduced at Bunnings. Posts on social media show lines stretching for hundreds of metres, and customers complaining of hour-long waits to enter stores.No snags, but big lines at @Bunnings today.Customer numbers limited in-store: 1 out, 1 in; 4 customers per aisle.Similar rules soon to be rolled out at @Coles & @woolworths Details @7NewsBrisbane tonight at 6pm pic.twitter.com/0a5E9tL0vk“The lines at Bunnings are enormous, they’re larger than most Dreamworld rides,” one person posted to Facebook.“Victoria police, if you want revenue just go down to your local Bunnings and ask what people are there for. If they are there to buy a plant then hit them up for a fine.”A spokeswoman for Coles said in order to combat lengthy wait times, the company has been encouraging customers to do their Easter weekend shopping earlier to avoid stores being overwhelmed on Thursday.Business hours for the major supermarkets have been extended to 10pm, and some Coles stores will remain open to midnight over the Easter weekend.In addition to these measures, from Monday, disabled Australians on the NDIS scheme will be able to access priority home delivery from Australia’s major supermarkets.NDIS participants will be sent a unique code by SMS, which they can enter at the end of their online shopping order to access the program.This is in addition to supermarkets instituting priority shopping hours for elderly and disabled people, and frontline medical workers.Australian Associated Press contributed to this report."

legislate Covid-19 eviction moratoriums as ACT accused of pursuing social housing tenants ","The Australian Capital Territory has pledged not to boot out public housing residents who fall behind on rent during the Coronavirus pandemic, after it was caught pursuing eviction orders against tenants despite the national cabinet’s six-month moratorium.As housing experts call for state and territory governments to enact these moratoriums into law, the Housing ACT was accused of continuing to pursue eviction orders at the ACT’s administrative tribunal over the past few days.With millions of Australians facing unemployment, the national cabinet agreed last week to the six-month moratorium on evictions to keep people in their homes during the coronavirus pandemic, but the measure has only been legislated in Tasmania.While most states such as New South Wales and Victoria have essentially suspended evictions for unpaid rent, the Guardian was told last week of at least two live public housing evictions cases at the ACT tribunal.In a letter to the housing minister on Monday, Canberra Community Law said that Housing ACT as well as community housing providers have continued to pursue evictions.The letter, which demands Yvette Berry enact a six-month moratorium, is signed by 20 local organisations and public advocates, including the ACT’s human rights commissioner Helen Watchirs and Jodie Griffiths-Cook, the ACT’s public advocate and children and young people commissioner.It stated that “applications for evictions continue to be issued against public housing tenants by the ACT government and by ACT government funded organisations against community housing tenants in the ACT”.Asked to respond to the letter, a spokesperson for Berry confirmed to the Guardian on Monday that the government would not evict ACT public housing tenants due to rental arrears.“All orders for evictions due to rental arrears will be postponed for the duration of the pandemic,” they said.The Guardian raised with the ACT’s Community Services Directorate that there were at least two current public housing eviction cases that were with the tribunal in recent days.Berry’s spokesperson confirmed that there were three existing eviction cases, and that the government would now consider “whether these can proceed in line with the national cabinet position”.In the case of an eviction tenants were relocated to “another public housing property or linked up with an appropriate specialist housing provider”.“The ACT government does not evict public housing tenants into homelessness,” the spokesperson said.The national cabinet’s declaration of a six-month eviction moratorium was aimed at ensuring “we won’t have anyone thrown out of their homes,” Morrison said last week.Asked about reports that some private landlords were continuing with evictions because there was no moratorium currently in law, Morrison said they needed to “do the right thing”.Chris Martin, a housing expert at the University of New South Wales, said only Tasmania had so far passed laws to enact a moratorium on evictions.“It hasn’t been affected in legislation anywhere else yet, and it really needs to be,” he told the Guardian.“In the week before the announcement that there would be a moratorium, NSW did pass urgently some amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act that would give the minister a power to make regulations that would prevent evictions.“The minister hasn’t exercised that power yet.”NSW’s Department of Communities and Justice said social housing tenants were not being evicted over arrears provided they agreed to a payment plan.Speaking before Berry’s office indicated it would postpone evictions, Sophie Trevitt, a social security and tenancy solicitor at Canberra Community Law, said there were “huge public health implications to evicting public housing tenants during a global health crisis”.“Public housing tenants by definition cannot afford to rent in the private rental market.“Therefore, if evicted, they face almost certain homelessness.”A spokesperson for NSW’s Department of Communities and Justice (DCJ) said it was not evicting social housing tenants for rental arrears “if they agree to an affordable repayment plan and automatic rent deduction for future payments”.They said the department had suspended rent increases and would not include the $550 per fortnight coronavirus supplement in social housing rents.“For the safety and security of all tenants living in social housing, DCJ will continue to take appropriate action in relation to matters of serious antisocial behaviour,” the spokesperson said.“In all cases we ensure appropriate support is offered to sustain a tenancy or provide alternative housing options.”In Victoria, public housing evictions have also been suspended with the exception of antisocial behaviour.Berry’s spokesperson said the ACT would still pursue evictions as a “last resort” to protect public safety.The Queensland government has indicated that it will pursue a retrospective six-month moratorium to protect tenants before the laws are passed.However, the state’s Residential Tenancies Authority said last week that all parties needed to be aware that their rights and responsibilities under the law “have not changed at this time”."
