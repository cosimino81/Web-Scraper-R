Scotland's chief medical officer quits over second home row
","
Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, has resigned her post after coming under intense criticism for breaking her own rules to twice visit her second home during the coronavirus outbreak.
In a statement issued on Sunday night, more than seven hours after insisting she would carry on, Calderwood said she had discussed her position with Nicola Sturgeon and concluded her position was untenable.
“I am deeply sorry for my actions and the mistakes I have made,” Calderwood said.
“The first minister and I have had a further conversation this evening and we have agreed that the justifiable focus on my behaviour risks becoming a distraction from the hugely important job that government and the medical profession has to do in getting the country through this coronavirus pandemic.
“Having worked so hard on the government’s response, that is the last thing I want.
“The most important thing to me now and over the next few very difficult months is that people across Scotland know what they need to do to reduce the spread of this virus and that means they must have complete trust in those who give them advice. It is with a heavy heart that I resign as chief medical officer.”
Earlier it emerged that she had visited her seaside holiday home in Fife twice over the last 10 days, including with her children this weekend, despite repeatedly warning the public that non-essential journeys risked lives. Calderwood will remain in the post and continue advising the Scottish government, but the current advertising campaign which features her will now be revised.
Police Scotland’s chief constable, Iain Livingstone, said his officers had given Calderwood a formal warning about her conduct after visiting her home on Sunday.
In an intervention designed to shore up public confidence in the lockdown, Livingstone used his force’s Twitter feed to chastise Calderwood.
“The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone,” he said. “Individuals must not make personal exemptions bespoke to their own circumstances.”
The first minister said during her daily media briefing on the crisis that she was extremely disappointed with Calderwood’s behaviour, but said she wanted her to stay in her post. “Whatever her reasons for doing so, she was wrong, and she knows that,” Sturgeon said, adding that Calderwood had given her an unreserved apology.

“If I’m to do what I need to do, to steer this country through the crisis to the very best of my ability I need her to be able to focus on the job she is doing,” Sturgeon said. “A job that – notwithstanding her mistake on this – she is doing extremely well.”
In a clear signal Sturgeon planned to defend her, Calderwood stood alongside the first minister during the briefing, which was being broadcast live online. Calderwood said she was “truly sorry” for breaching her own advice not to travel, and acknowledged NHS staff had attacked her conduct.
“I have seen a lot of the comments from members of the public on Twitter today, people calling me a hypocrite, people telling me what hardships they have endured while following my guidance,” she said. “What I did was wrong, I’m very sorry. It will not happen again.”

Facing repeated questions about Calderwood’s actions, Sturgeon was asked several times whether the chief medical officer had tendered her resignation. Sturgeon refused to confirm or deny that she had, but hinted Calderwood had offered to step down and that her offer was rejected.
She said: “The chief medical officer made clear to me she would do whatever she is required to do to in my judgment to be in the best interests of the country. It is my view that that would not be her resignation because that would deprive me and the government of her expertise.”
As the controversy intensified during the day on Sunday, a Scottish government advert featuring Calderwood’s warnings against all unjustified travel was still being broadcast, in which she said: “This is a vital update about coronavirus. To help save lives, stay at home. Anyone can spread coronavirus.
“Only go out when absolutely necessary for food, medicine, work or exercise … Stay home. Protect Scotland’s NHS and save lives.”
Labour and the Liberal Democrats urged Calderwood to quit on Sunday after the Sun published photographs of Calderwood, her husband, three children and dog taking walks near their second home in Earlsferry, in the East Neuk of Fife, on Saturday. That included a visit to a nearby beach.

Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader and a local MSP, said residents in the picturesque village were furious about an influx of second-home owners arriving there over the weekend. Backed by Scottish Labour, he said Calderwood’s actions would weaken public confidence in the lockdown.
“The main street was described as being like a motorway and many second homes are full up,” he said in a joint statement with Wendy Chamberlain, the local Lib Dem MP and a former police officer. “There is real concern that with a swollen population and a virus sweeping through, the local health services will just not cope.”
Sturgeon deflected questions about the candour of her government’s first statements defending the chief medical officer’s actions, and fielded questions that reporters had put to Calderwood.
On Saturday, the Scottish government said Calderwood had been working “seven days a week” and “she took the opportunity this weekend to check on a family home in Fife as she knows she will not be back again until the crisis is over”.
That statement failed to explain why the whole family needed to go or stay overnight. During the briefing on Sunday, Calderwood admitted she and her husband had also gone to Earlsferry the previous weekend – a fact not disclosed by the government on Saturday.

'Trump is killing his own supporters' – even White House insiders know it
","
On Sunday, initially at least, there was no White House briefing on the president’s public schedule. But the bad news kept coming. Coronavirus deaths continued to climb and reports of the heartland being unprepared for what may be on its horizon continued to ricochet around the media.



Jared Kushner's coronavirus overreach puts more American lives on the line | Lloyd Green

In the words of one administration insider, to the Guardian: “The Trump organism is simply collapsing. He’s killing his own supporters.”
Members of the national guard, emergency workers, rank-and-file Americans: all are exposed. Yet Trump appears incapable of emoting anything that comes close to heart-felt concern. Or just providing straight answers.
Rather, he is acting like Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America: repeatedly letting governors know the burden of shoring up their sick, their doctors and their people falls on their shoulders first. The national government? It’s the world’s greatest backstop.
Remember when the Republican party freaked out about Barack Obama and the US “leading from behind” abroad? Remember the howls that evoked from GOP leaders? Those days are gone. Welcome to what Martin O’Malley, a Democratic former governor of Maryland, calls the “Darwinian approach to federalism”.



There is nothing like populism marinated in wholesale contempt for the populace

Trump is telling NFL owners he wants the season to start on time. He is disregarding Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advice on wearing facemasks in public. And he is touting untested coronavirus cures live on national TV.
Think Trump University on steroids, only this time we all stand to be the victims.
When Dr Anthony Fauci says there is no evidence to back up Trump’s claims surrounding hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, pay attention. The fact Jared Kushner is on the case is hardly reassuring. He’s the guy who thought firing James Comey was win-win politics and promised Middle East peace in our time.
While all this is going on, the Wisconsin Republican party is giving America a taste of the campaign to come in the fall. Right now, the Badger State GOP is fighting in the US supreme court efforts to extend mail-in voting for this Tuesday’s Democratic primary.
In other words, voters will be forced to choose between foregoing their rights and risking their lives. Democracy shouldn’t work that way.
Back in the day, Republicans looked upon absentee voting as a valuable adjunct, a key piece in the party’s election day arsenal. Not anymore. Instead it is a dreaded foe, a fact readily admitted by Trump on Fox & Friends this week. If the US were to adopt mail-in voting, said the president, “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again”.
For good measure, Trump later declared from the White House: “I think a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting.”
For the record, Trump voted by mail in 2018. In March, the Palm Beach Post reported that he had requested a mail-in vote for the Florida Republican primary.
There is nothing like populism marinated in wholesale contempt for the populace. In case Trump and the Republicans forgot, “We the People” are the constitution’s first three words.



If you can leave your soldiers to suffer then no American is truly safe

Sadly, once again we are reminded that Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe’s masterpiece, Gladiator, is the movie for this presidency and its tumultuous times. In one scene, a senator, Gracchus, attempts to confront Commodus, the emperor, about a plague spreading through Rome. The emperor declines, threatens the senator and muses about disbanding the Senate.
On Thursday, Trump forced the removal of Captain Brett Crozier from his command of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, for having the temerity to plead his sailors’ case as more than 100 of them tested positive for coronavirus.
If you can leave your soldiers to suffer then no American is truly safe, no matter what Jeanine Pirro may say. Crozier left the ship to the cheers of the crew – then reportedly tested positive himself.
Hours after dismissing Crozier, Trump sacked Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community’s inspector general, for simply doing his job. Trump’s Ukraine call was never perfect, however many times he says it was.

Hail Caesar, indeed.
Whether Trump wins reelection is an open question. For now, the economy is cratering and the coronavirus death toll has exploded. Not a promising combination. Herbert Hoover faced a depression, not a plague. Trump may contend with both.
According to Chris Christie, a former New Jersey governor and the man who sent Charlie Kushner, Jared’s father, to prison, November will be a referendum on Trump. Joe Biden is nearly irrelevant.
For the moment, Trump holds a commanding lead among Republicans. Seven months from now, we will learn if party loyalty is enough to secure a second term.

Who runs the country if Boris Johnson is out of action?
","
In his role as first secretary of state, the prime minister’s de facto deputy, Dominic Raab will be expected to stand in for Boris Johnson if he is unable to work because of coronavirus.
While other ministers, including the health secretary Matt Hancock and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have been more visible during the Covid-19 outbreak, that position means he takes up the prime minister’s responsibilities if Johnson were unable to perform them himself.
Until now aides to the prime minister have insisted that Johnson can continue to work by video link, like much of the rest of the workforce. But on Sunday night Downing Street said that Raab was expected to chair the government’s coronavirus meeting on Monday morning. No 10 said that despite Raab’s duties, Johnson remained in charge.
Like many of the government’s key decision-makers, Raab was a prominent figure in the 2016 Vote Leave campaign, sent out to tour TV studios and staff up the spin rooms for debates.
Unlike Michael Gove, whose dramatic intervention in that summer’s leadership contest has been forgiven but not forgotten, Raab is implicitly trusted by Johnson and his team. Also unlike Gove, he resigned rather than accept Theresa May’s Brexit deal – seen as the ultimate test of a true believer.
Raab has tested negative for coronavirus himself, having come down with a cough.
It has also been reported that if Johnson’s key aides, Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain, were to be incapacitated, they would be replaced by Conservative campaign director Isaac Levido. Cummings also displayed symptoms of coronavirus last weekend.

Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar to work a day a week as a doctor
","
Leo Varadkar is to work one day a week as a doctor to help combat the coronavirus pandemic after reactivating his medical credentials.
Ireland’s taoiseach has offered his services to the Health Service Executive (HSE) in areas that are within his competence, a spokesperson for his office said on Sunday.
“Dr Varadkar rejoined the medical register last month,” a spokesperson told the Guardian. “He has offered his services to the HSE for one session a week in areas that are within his scope of practice.

“Many of his family and friends are working in the health service. He wanted to help out even in a small way.’
Varadkar, 41, worked as a junior doctor in Dublin and qualified as a GP in 2010 before quitting medicine to become a full-time politician, and later becoming premier.
Last month the HSE appealed to all healthcare professionals who were not already working in the public health service to register to be “on call for Ireland”. Thousands of nurses, doctors, medical students and others have responded, some coming out of retirement, others flying back from abroad.
The Irish Times, which first reported the story, said the taoiseach was understood to be doing phone assessments, in keeping with the protocol to advise people who could be infected over the phone rather than in person.
Varadkar’s father Ashok, an Indian immigrant, was a GP and his mother Miriam was a nurse. His partner Matthew Barrett is a cardiologist.
He has won plaudits from across the political spectrum for his handling of the coronavirus crisis. Ireland adopted early restrictions and appears to have avoided an unmitigated pandemic, though cases are expected to surge this week.
Varadkar succeeded Enda Kenny in 2017 as leader of Fine Gael, a centrist party, and as taoiseach. He earned praise for his handling of the economy and Brexit talks but in a general election in February voters punished the party for failures in housing and healthcare.
Varadkar was expected to run a caretaker administration before leading Fine Gael into opposition. However Sinn Féin, which won more votes than any other party, has not formed a governing coalition. Fine Gael and another centrist party, Fianna Fáil, are in talks to form a historic coalition that would see Varadkar rotate the position of taoiseach with the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin.

Hertfordshire hospital forced to consider who should be refused oxygen
","
Oxygen supplies at a Hertfordshire hospital inundated with coronavirus patients became so precarious last week that officials considered how to decide who should receive the gas and who should miss out and likely die, the Guardian understands.
The oxygen system at Watford general hospital came close to breaking point on Saturday, when a critical incident was declared and staff had to tell the public not to come to the hospital. Some patients were moved out to prevent the vital system failing.
Last week, health planners in Hertfordshire, where more than 800 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, became so concerned about oxygen supplies they alerted the military that they might need help. The area has been under huge pressure from the Covid-19 pandemic, with mortuary space filling up and plans being made to increase capacity four-fold. As of 5pm Thursday, 29 people had died at West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS trust hospitals after being diagnosed with Covid-19. The trust is responsible for Watford general as well as Hemel Hempstead and St Albans City hospitals.
A senior clinician said: “They were [consulting] the hospital ethics committee every day and considering who they were not going to oxygenate and ventilate if they needed it, and making decisions about who would be triaged to not have oxygen and die.”

The decision to announce a critical incident on Saturday meant no one had to go without oxygen, the trust said.
Oxygen therapy is key to the successful treatment of advanced cases of Covid-19, and last Tuesday NHS England warned hospitals across the country about the risk to supplies in an urgent patient safety notice. It highlighted the dramatic recent increase in hospitals’ use of ventilators and in particular CPAP machines, which dispense ventilation through a face mask.
The pressure on Watford general’s oxygen system was not unexpected, according to documents seen by the Guardian.
Last week, healthcare planners in the area said they pleaded with the government and the NHS to urgently approve works to the hospital’s oxygen system and warned NHS England on Wednesday that the situation was critical.
However, NHS England said that it had alerted trusts, including West Hertfordshire, to the need to prepare their oxygen systems in February when the threat of the coronavirus epidemic was looming.
“All trusts were written to by NHS England in February reminding them to carry out engineering checks on ventilation equipment, and were further issued with guidance on how to use the kit safely, on 1 April,” a spokesperson said.
Works to overhaul Watford general’s oxygen supply system had been planned before the outbreak, but were put on hold. Local planners felt their attempts to get them urgently restarted were frustrated by communication difficulties in central government, the documents show.
On Friday, the day before the critical incident was declared, the planners considered making a military aid request and began a process that could allow the armed forces to step in and help.

“On 30 March, the multi-agency group in Hertfordshire asked the government to get the works moving as they had been planned for some time, and they noted how urgent they were, but nothing happened,” the senior clinician said. “There was no response. On 1 April, the trust reported that they were at max capacity for oxygen and we raised the issue with NHS England and got nowhere.”
West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS trust declined to comment beyond giving its account of the incident on Saturday.
The trust said it was “a technical issue with our individual hospital’s oxygen equipment, which does not pose any risk to our patients”. It added that “a safe level of oxygen [was] maintained throughout”. The incident was triggered by growing concern that the system was close to capacity, sources said.
However, NHS England said it was not a result of capacity problems “but due to a technical fault in their oxygen ventilation equipment, which engineers are now fixing, with the critical incident stood down last night.”
Referring to consultations with the ethics committee about what would happen in the event of severe oxygen problems, the NHS England spokesperson said: “The incident did not lead to any patient harm, however in any major incident it is absolutely right that hospitals plan for every possible scenario to manage patient care.”
Daisy Cooper, Liberal Democrat MP for St Albans, said: “I raised the question of possible oxygen shortages with the government privately more than a week ago and this weekend Watford general A&E had to close for a day because its oxygen equipment malfunctioned.“The government must now ensure that Watford general has whatever resources it needs to shore up ventilation systems, given the expectation that numbers of Covid-19 patients will continue to rise in the coming days.“For hospitals like Watford general which are near capacity, we need to know now what steps will be taken to signpost coronavirus patients, in real time, to the nearest medical facilities with capacity. The government must commit that, if needed, it will relocate Hertfordshire patients with coronavirus to the new Nightingale hospital in London, or build additional field hospitals to serve areas including Hertfordshire.” 
A senior consultant in London warned that hospitals in the capital were also reaching capacity. “We had a meeting at midday on Saturday with other south London hospitals to look at beds data, as we are pretty much full,” the doctor told the Guardian.

 Coronavirus: opening of emergency Nightingale hospital in London – watch live
“The Nightingale hospital will only open just in time, and for the next few days we are managing capacity as best we can … everywhere is up to the limit. That is reflective of elsewhere in London,” he added.
He said that transferring patients across hospitals through the South London transfer network has “saved multiple lives and them offloading us prevents us from making difficult choices. We would have run out of ventilators if we could not have transferred patients out to other hospitals”.
He said: “My fear is that I will end up confronting a patient who I would need to intubate but do not have the machines to do it, so being unable to help a patient as I don’t have the kit. I hope not to be in that situation, but the fear would be that I am.”

Boris Johnson admitted to hospital with coronavirus
","
Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital with coronavirus after suffering persistent symptoms for 10 days.
Downing Street insisted it was just a precautionary measure but Johnson’s admission on a Sunday evening comes after days of rumours that his condition has been worsening.
A Downing Street spokesperson said: “On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.”
Johnson is reported to be in an NHS hospital in London where he will stay for “as long as needed”.
It is understood Johnson remains in charge of the government, although Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is poised to take charge if he should worsen.
Raab, who is the designated minister to take over if the PM is incapacitated, will chair the 9.15am Monday meeting of the government’s C-19 committee, which leads the response to the pandemic.
Johnson had been hoping to leave quarantine on Friday after seven days of self isolation but his persistent temperature meant he had to remain inside his flat at No 11 Downing Street.
The Guardian was told last week that Johnson was more seriously ill than either he or his officials were prepared to admit, and that he was being seen by doctors who were concerned about his breathing.
But Downing Street flatly denied that the prime minister’s health had seriously deteriorated, and insisted there were no plans at that point for him to be admitted to hospital.
Earlier on Sunday, Matt Hancock was asked just how ill the prime minister was. The health secretary told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “He’s OK. I’ve been talking to him every day, several times a day… he’s very much got his hand on the tiller. But he’s still got a temperature.” He added: “He’s working away inside Downing Street. He’s in good spirits.”
Hancock himself has only recently come out from isolation after testing positive for coronavirus, although his symptoms appear to have been notably milder.
Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, revealed on Saturday that she had also been suffering from the virus but is recovering.
Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader, was among a string of MPs to tweet their best wishes to Johnson. “Wishing the prime minister well and a speedy recovery,” he wrote.
Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary and Johnson’s main rival for the Conservative leadership last year, tweeted: “Thoughts with Boris Johnson this evening. Whatever political persuasion the whole country is united in wanting our PM to get fit and well as soon as possible.”

Coronavirus 'game changer' testing kits could be unreliable, UK scientists say
","
The huge stock of 17.5m antibody home testing kits ordered by the government after Boris Johnson said they could be a “game changer” could in fact be unreliable, scientists have said, saying that they may fail to detect up to half of coronavirus cases.
After the prospect of the pregnancy test-style kits was first raised, it was suggested the tests would be made available “within days” on Amazon and via Boots, to allow people who have had the virus to return to the workplace confident in the knowledge that they are safe.
But in recent days, ministers have appeared to play down the likelihood of the tests being universally effective, with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, saying on Sunday that the tests were not yet “good enough”.
Now scientists involved in validating home testing kits have told the Guardian that no test on the market has yet been shown to be sufficiently reliable. Some kits, which claim a more than 90% rate of accuracy, appear to have been tested only in hospital on patients with very significant symptoms.



'Absolutely wrong': how UK's coronavirus test strategy unravelled







Read more





One expert told the Guardian that in reality the sensitivity of the tests was likely to be relatively low and more likely to detect 50%-60% of those with milder symptoms – the group for whom the tests were intended.
The warnings over the limit to the value of the tests came as another 621 deaths were announced, a drop on the previous day’s record total of 708.
Meanwhile on Sunday:
• Hancock criticised the “unbelievable” behaviour of people packing into parks at the weekend and said rules on exercise could change before clarifying that the government was “not planning any changes imminently”.
• Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, apologised after it emerged that she went to her second home during the lockdown and withdrew from being the public face of the government’s information campaign north of the border.
• Italy recorded its lowest number of cases in two weeks, with the total number of people in hospital with the virus falling for the first time since the beginning of the crisis.
• Sweden prepared legislation to allow it to take “extraordinary steps” to tackle the crisis, as concerns continued that its unusual “slow spread” strategy was not working.
• A nurse and a midwife who died last week in the UK were named, while the Marquess of Bath, the owner of Longleat safari park, was also announced to have died.
The scepticism over the value of the tests comes at a time of ongoing concern over whether the details of UK government pledges on coronavirus stand up to scrutiny. Last week ministers were widely criticised for fluctuating claims over the total number of tests that could be conducted each day, with Boris Johnson’s initial claim that 250,000 was possible superseded by Hancock’s promise to scale up to 100,000 a day by the end of April.
On Sunday, Hancock appeared to contradict himself over the production of the ventilators crucial to treatment of the most severe coronavirus cases, telling the BBC that there “should be another 1,500” in a week’s time before telling the Downing Street briefing “we haven’t got an exact figure”.
He had announced the purchase of 3.5m antibody test kits on 24 March but a week later it emerged that they had not been bought, but rather had “contracts agreed subject to testing”.
The big range in immune response seen across the population also raises the troubling prospect that those who have had mild symptoms may not have long-term immunity against Covid-19.
Prof Marion Koopmans, head of virology at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, whose lab is assessing home testing kits in the Netherlands, said: “So far, I’m not aware of any home tests that have passed our quality mark. Based on what I’ve seen so far I’d be hesitant to give you an immunity passport based on a rapid test result.”
A senior UK scientist who is working on lab-based antibody testing for Covid-19, said that given the current state of knowledge he was “amazed the government had sufficient confidence” to go ahead with the purchase of millions of tests. “A lot of us did a double-take,” he said.
Another UK scientist said that none of the home test kits currently under evaluation in the UK were performing well enough, but did not give specific performance figures.
Last month, Boris Johnson described the kits, which take as little as 20 minutes to use, as a potential “game changer” and their use is outlined in the government’s five pillar testing strategy. However, this weekend Hancock played down expectations, telling BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show that there were no immediate plans to roll out antibody testing kits. “We’re getting the test results through every day, I was looking at some last night,” he said. “But we still don’t have any that are good enough.”
Emerging evidence suggests that there is a wide range of antibody responses to coronavirus across the population, which may make the development of a simple, reliable home test that will work for everyone a considerable challenge. 
Dr David Ho, a leading infectious disease specialist at Columbia University in New York, said that, based on patient samples analysed by his team, those with severe illness tend to develop a faster and stronger antibody response. In people with milder symptoms, the presence of antibodies in the blood tends to ramp up more slowly, meaning that tests need to performed later.
“The problem is after a couple of weeks, the detection rate remains at about 50%-60%, especially in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases,” Ho said. “But this may not be a fault of the tests, because even using more sensitive methods in the lab we can see the antibody levels are quite low.”
It is not yet clear whether this 50%-60% figure will improve much if people are tested three or four weeks after infection. To answer this, recovered patients need to be tracked for a longer period, but Koopmans is not optimistic that the detection rate will reach the levels seen in severe cases.
“The sensitivity of these tests, I expect, will be relatively low,” she said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you end up around 50%-60%. Even if they’re not that costly, why burn all those assays if that’s the information you get?”

Some of the commercial home tests claim, in promotional materials, to have sensitivities above 90%. However, these figures are likely to be based on tests in patients recovering in hospital, who represent the most severe end of the spectrum in terms of symptoms. “There’s this missing piece of how does it work in the 85% of people in the other category,” said Koopmans.
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Antibody tests offer the hope that people who think they have had the disease will know they are immune and get back to life as normal. We are currently working with several companies who are offering these tests and are evaluating their effectiveness.
“The Covid[-19] scientific advisory panel, led by Prof Sir John Bell, is currently undertaking a rapid evaluation process to establish their reliability. We will publish the results of this evaluation once it is completed.”

Brett Crozier, the US Navy captain who was removed from his command this week after he wrote a memo expressing concern for the health of crew members exposed to coronavirus, has himself tested positive, the New York Times first reported.

The Times report cited two US Naval Academy classmates close to Crozier’s family. The details of Crozier’s condition were unclear.
Crozier was dismissed as captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, after writing a letter alerting navy leaders that Covid-19 aboard the vessel was threatening the lives of his sailors.
“The spread of the disease is ongoing and accelerating,” he wrote.
As he left the ship following his dismissal, Crozier was cheered exuberantly by his former crew.
On Saturday, Donald Trump said he did not think Crozier should have written the letter, which he said was a “terrible” thing to do.
“The letter was a five-page letter from a captain, and the letter was all over the place,” Trump said at a White House briefing. “That’s not appropriate.”
“I thought it was terrible, what he did, to write a letter. I mean, this isn’t a class on literature. This is a captain of a massive ship that’s nuclear powered. And he shouldn’t be talking that way in a letter.”
The Washington Post has reported that acting navy secretary Thomas Modly “told one colleague [on] Wednesday, the day before he announced the move: ‘Breaking news: Trump wants him fired’.”
The president said: “I didn’t make the decision.”
Defense secretary Mark Esper defended the decision to dismiss Crozier on cable news on Sunday morning, saying “when all those facts come to bear we’ll have a chance to understand” why the decision was taken.
Esper told CNN’s State of the Union he supported the decision to relieve Crozier, which he said was made by navy leadership, but “there is an investigation ongoing”.
Esper said “we need to take care of the sailors on the ship”, adding that there have been 155 positive coronavirus tests on the Roosevelt.
Presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden called Crozier’s dismissal “close to criminal”.
“It’s close to criminal the way they’re dealing with this guy,” the former vice-president told ABC’s This Week. “The idea that this man stood up and said what had to be said, got it out that his troops, his navy personnel were in danger … Look how many have the virus.
“I think he should have a commendation rather than be fired.”

Queen praises the people, if not the government, and pulls off a tough gig
","
Now we know just how serious things are. The UK has just wheeled out its biggest gun. The Queen has only ever given an unscheduled TV address to the nation on four previous occasions, either when the nation or the royal family itself was under threat. And as sure as hell Her Majesty wasn’t about to update us on Prince Andrew handing himself over to the FBI or Harry and Meghan’s ongoing flat hunting nightmare; this could only mean the country was in a coronavirus crisis.
Keeping one hand firmly clasped around her wrist and her body a safe distance from a lone BBC cameraman dressed in a hazmat suit – there’s no shortage of personal protective equipment in Windsor Castle – the Queen, interspersed with footage of NHS workers and the wider general public, spoke to the country from her study. Wisely, she kept it short and sweet. This wasn’t a Christmas message when half the country would be pissed and the other half wouldn’t be listening. Now every sentence would be picked over and every word would count.
The Queen began by acknowledging the challenges everyone was facing: death; financial hardship (some more than others, when it comes to the royal family); and separation, before going on to praise the selflessness of those in the NHS and other frontline emergency services. She then said how much she hoped people would maintain the self-sacrifice, self-discipline, compassion and sense of humour needed to defeat the illness.
On the hottest weekend of the year so far, this rang a little hollow as most of the country appeared to have gone outdoors with the sole purpose of snitching on any people they came across who weren’t keeping the appropriate safe distance from one another. B&Q have had a massive run on tape measures in the past week. It won’t be long before there’s also a black market in tasers to take out sweaty joggers.
After a nod to the Commonwealth and the global nature of the pandemic – this wasn’t the plucky Brits taking on the might of Nazi Germany singlehandedly in 1940 – the Queen mentioned a previous address she and Princess Margaret had made to the nation in 1940. Still, she could be forgiven the solipsism as she had done her bit during the second world war, having spent the latter years of the war driving military trucks. As yet there were no promises to turn any of the royal palaces into field hospitals or emergency supply depots, though she might be holding that in reserve for another day.
The Queen ended with a promise that better days would one day return and that in the meantime we should hold our nerve and do our best to be the generation of which future ones would be proud. We can but hope. She even came over a bit Vera Lynn, promising us “we’ll meet again”. Only without the singing. Small mercies. Maybe next time. Given the circumstances, it had been more or less a pitch perfect speech. After all there’s only a certain amount a head of state can say at times like these.
But one thing was notable by its absence. Although it’s her job to be apolitical, there was no mention of the government’s efforts or requests to follow official advice. Her Maj still hasn’t forgotten how she was used, and made a fool of, by Boris Johnson over the prorogation and pointless Queen’s speech. In Boris, she doesn’t trust. But then who does?
The subtext was unmistakeable. If the country was to survive, it would do so through the collective resolve of its people, not through a government that had been slow to react and was still making promises it did not know it would be able to keep. And with that she faded out after little less than four minutes.
Throughout, her face remained more or less expressionless – inscrutability to hide the pain – but she had done what was required. Simply by being there, she had shown she cared. She had provided the clear moral leadership that many politicians have failed to provide. For some people nothing she could have said would have been enough, while others would have taken comfort. Most people probably wouldn’t have cared much either way. But it was a necessary rite of passage. And a tough gig when underneath you’re just as scared – if not more so, given her age – as everyone else. There’s no disguising it: the Queen’s a class act.

UK sunbathers may trigger stricter coronavirus lockdowns
","
Parks across the UK could be closed unless more people adhere to social distancing rules, after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said those using public spaces to sunbathe were putting people’s lives at risk and may trigger stricter lockdown measures.
Despite Sunday’s warm temperatures, fewer people visited parks than usual, but scenes in Brockwell Park in south London on Saturday – where 3,000 people gathered – were widely condemned and led to the park being temporarily closed.
Police said they also had to move more than 100 people from Primrose Hill in London after they were found with “full picnics or blankets, sunbathing”.
On Sunday morning, Hancock said he could be forced to take action before later saying that any change would not be immediate.
He told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “I think this example of exercise is a really important one, because we’ve said because of the positive benefits to your physical and your mental health that it’s OK to exercise on your own or with members of your own household.
“But if the result of that is that too many people go out and flout the other rules because they say: ‘Well, if I can exercise then it’s fine for me to do other things,’ then I’m afraid we will have to take action.”
But he later clarified his position, saying: “‘We can’t rule out further steps but I don’t want anyone to think that any changes to the social distancing rules are imminent, because the vast majority are following the rules.”
The temporary closure of Brockwell Park and images of sunbathers from around the country triggered a debate about the use of parks by people who do not have accessible outdoor space during the Covid-19 lockdown.
Hancock was backed by the newly-elected Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who said his party would support either a ban on outdoor exercise or on non-essential work if it was needed to curb the spread of Covid-19.
“We do have to take whatever steps are necessary,” said Starmer, who said social distancing was difficult for people who did not have a garden to exercise in, but insisted “we’ve got to get through this”.
Angela Rayner, who was elected as Labour’s deputy leader, said on Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “It’s all right for people who’ve got big houses and huge back gardens to say that, but if you’re stuck in inadequate accommodation, you’ve got no back garden, nowhere to go, and you’re on top of each other, people should do social distancing, but also be reasonable and proportionate about that.”
The Royal Parks – the charity that manages several parks in London, including Primrose Hill, Greenwich Park and Hyde Park, which were all busy over the weekend – said its spaces would remain open for now.
“Our sole priority at the moment is to keep the parks open and safe for as long as possible, and we’re doing everything we can to ensure this is the case,” a spokesperson said. The charity has previously banned cycling through Richmond Park because of congestion and shut all cafes, catering kiosks and playgrounds at its sites.

Officials in Birmingham, which has had the largest amount of confirmed Covid-19 cases of any local authority outside of London, encouraged residents to practise social distancing while continuing to keep its parks open.

London Councils – the membership group representing the 32 London boroughs and the City of London – said if people failed to follow government advice stricter restrictions on movement could follow.

Brockwell Park is 50.8 hectares of space. Even if all 3000 people were in there at the same time they could have 169 square metres alone each. You're taking green space away from many who have no other option. Please deal with the groups instead of collectively punishing. https://t.co/fvep2G4JEu

Wail Qasim, the writer and social commentator, used Brockwell Park on Saturday and questioned the logic behind the decision to close it on Sunday, saying it punished the many because of the actions of the few. “Brockwell Park is 50.8 hectares of space. Even if all 3,000 people were in there at the same time they could have 169 square metres alone each,” Qasim tweeted.

Horse trading: Arnold Schwarzenegger puts Whiskey and Lulu to work
","
It is nine years since Arnold Schwarzenegger was the governor of California, but the former movie – together with his pet donkey Lulu and miniature horse Whiskey – has issued an important coronavirus directive to the state’s 40 million residents: Don’t be an ass, stay inside.

Schwarzenegger, 72, is emerging as a prominent face in the Golden State’s battle against the pandemic, his lighthearted social media posts featuring his self-isolation antics with the two animals and his pet dog Cherry going viral while the virus continues to spread.
In March, a short Twitter video of the actor sharing quarantine food at his dining room table and urging people to stay indoors amassed more than 13.3 million views.
Now Schwarzenegger has turned to his 20 million Instagram followers to launch a range of T-shirts and hoodies featuring the animals and the stay-at-home message, with the intention of raising money for underprivileged families affected by the crisis.
“With schools closed, we can’t provide our normal programming for our 100,000 kids, but we take our commitment to our families seriously, so we are pivoting to use our after-school staff to deliver groceries to our families,” Schwarzenegger said in a post on Represent, an internet marketplace for charitable and campaign products launched by celebrities.
Schwarzenegger founded the After-School All-Stars program in 1993 to enrich the lives of teenagers in California, mostly from racial minorities and financially-challenged families.
“No one is allowed out, especially someone that is 72 years old,” he said in the March video, which appeared the same week as the current California governor Gavin Newsom issued the formal statewide stay-at-home order for all residents.
“After you’re 65, you’re not allowed out of the house. We don’t go out. We don’t go to restaurants. We don’t do anything like that anymore here. We just eat with Whiskey and with Lulu. We have a good time.”

'We will meet again': Queen urges Britons to stay strong
","
The Queen has praised Britain’s “national spirit” in facing the challenge of coronavirus as she evoked wartime memories to reassure those “feeling a painful sense of separation from their loved ones” to take comfort in the fact: “We will meet again.”
In only the fifth special televised broadcast, other than Christmas messages, of her long reign, she said: “While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal.”
“We will succeed – and that success will belong to every one of us,” she said.
And she drew on the memories of her first broadcast to the nation some 80 years ago, when she and her sister, Margaret, made a radio broadcast for Children’s Hour.
Speaking with a picture from that first recording visible behind her, she said: “We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety.

“Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones. But now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do.”
She added: “We should take comfort that, while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.”
The government hopes that an intervention from the Queen, planned in close consultation with Downing Street, will help to shore up public commitment to self-isolation guidelines amid fears that warmer weather could lead some to waver.
There had been speculation the Queen might broadcast on Easter Sunday. But it is understood that both Buckingham Palace and Downing Street ultimately agreed on Sunday night as the best moment to maximise the impact of her speech. A senior No 10 official said the palace and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, “have been speaking throughout” about the timing.
“The Queen is the best judge of when to talk to the country and we absolutely agree that now is the right time,” the official said. “We have asked the country to make huge sacrifices and life is very difficult at the moment for a great many people. Hearing from Her Majesty the Queen at this time is an important way of helping to lift the nation’s spirits.”
The Queen, 94 this month and in good health, recorded her message at Windsor Castle, where she and the Duke of Edinburgh, 98, are staying for the foreseeable future.
The broadcast was filmed in extraordinary circumstances, with only one cameraman, wearing personal protective equipment, allowed into the White Drawing Room with the monarch to mitigate the risks to both her and others.
In a rare and deeply personal address to the nation and Commonwealth, she acknowledged the “pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones”.
She praised NHS frontline workers, care workers and those carrying out other essential roles “who selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of all of us”. She told them: “Every hour of your hard work brings us closer to a return to more normal times.”
She also thanked those who were staying at home, “thereby helping to protect the vulnerable”. In a rallying call, she added: “Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it.”
Her hope, she said, was that those in years to come would look back and say that this generation of Britons “were as strong as any”. She added: “The pride in who we are is not part of our past, it defines our present and our future.”
It was, she said, an increasingly challenging time of disruption, “a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all”.
Her message incorporated footage of NHS frontline staff, workers making deliveries, the armed forces constructing the NHS Nightingale London field hospital and video of the #clapforourcarers moments around the country, along with pictures of rainbows drawn by children.

 Clap for carers: millions applaud NHS staff on coronavirus frontlines – video report
“The moments when the United Kingdom has come together to applaud its care and essential workers will be remembered as an expression of our national spirit, and its symbol will be the rainbows drawn by children,” she said.
The message made no direct mention of the Queen’s own family’s experience of coronavirus: Prince Charles contracted and recovered from the illness.
Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty magazine, said the Queen would have wanted the focus to be on people such as the carers and key workers. “I think the message was more as monarch rather than as mother,” he said.
Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, tweeted: “The Queen speaks for the whole country and our determination to defeat coronavirus.” 
Apart from her Christmas message, it is rare for the monarch to make a special televised address. She has previously done so at the time of the Gulf war in 1991, on the eve of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, on the death of the Queen Mother in 2002, and on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012.

Coronavirus: Essex midwife and Liverpool nurse who died are named
","
A midwife and a nurse who died after contracting coronavirus have been named as loved ones and colleagues paid tribute to them.
Lynsay Coventry, 54, who worked at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow in Essex, died on Thursday, the first publicly confirmed death of a serving NHS midwife in England linked to Covid-19.
Liz Glanister, a staff nurse at Aintree University hospital in Liverpool, died on Friday.
Coventry’s family paid tribute to her as a “very well-respected midwife”, adding: “Our hearts are broken at the loss of our loving, wonderful and caring mum, sister, daughter and grandmother. We each know how much she loved and cherished us. Her love for us all was unfailing and her strength in the way she cared and supported us will fill our memories.”
Coventry’s family said she had trained as a midwife later in life to “follow her dream”. She “saw the midwifery team at the Princess Alexandra hospital as her other family”, the family statement said, noting how proud she was of her work. She had worked at the hospital for a decade.

Lance McCarthy, the chief executive of the hospital’s NHS trust, said Coventry would be remembered “for her professionalism and commitment to the women she supported”, adding: “Her loss will be felt by the maternity team and colleagues from across the organisation.”
He said Coventry had self-isolated after developing symptoms and had not been at work in the time before her death.
Gill Walton, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, said Coventry’s death was “not only a tragedy for her family, friends and colleagues, but also for all the women and children she touched during her career”.
“It’s important to remember that the NHS frontline doesn’t only apply to those working in intensive care or direct Covid support, but to midwives and others. Today we mourn the loss of Lynsay. Help us honour her life by doing what you can to reduce the impact of this pandemic and stay at home.”
Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, the chief midwifery officer for England, said: “I was deeply moved and saddened to hear about the death of Lynsay Coventry. Lynsay was clearly a highly regarded midwife whose dedication to women, babies and their families will be remembered and cherished by her own family and her colleagues.”
She said the most fitting way to support NHS staff such as Coventry was to stay at home during the outbreak.
Glanister’s death was confirmed by the Liverpool University hospitals NHS foundation trust chief nurse, Dianne Brown.
“It is with great sadness that I can confirm that Liz Glanister, a long-serving staff nurse at Aintree University hospital, sadly passed away at the Royal Liverpool University hospital on Friday after being tested positive for Covid-19,” she said.
“All our thoughts are with Liz’s family at this time and we offer them our sincere condolences. Liz will be sadly missed by all those who knew and worked with her.”

Factcheck: What are UK's new monthly coronavirus testing goals?
","
Amid an ever increasing level of scrutiny over the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, Matt Hancock appeared on the airwaves on Sunday to reassure the public that Downing Street was in control of the pandemic.
Here we weigh up what the health secretary said against previous statements and the latest developments.
What was said
On BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show:




I’ve set a very clear goal for the nation as a whole. The whole life sciences industry are coming to the table on this. I didn’t say it would be easy to get to 100,000 a day, I said we need to get to 100,000 a day.


Factcheck
Hancock seemed to be describing the 100,000 tests per day as a broader ambition for the country, including the life sciences industry. When the figure was first introduced, the Department of Health stated that the UK “will” carry out 100,000 tests for coronavirus every day by the end of this month. Is this pledge being watered down into an ambition?
What was said
On Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday:




We set a goal of 10,000 tests a day by the end of March and we hit that goal.


Factcheck
Testing passed 10,000 a day for the first time on 2 April. The government previously said the capacity for 10,000 tests was met and the shortfall in actual tests was due to hospitals failing to use this capacity to the full.
What was said
Also on Sophy Ridge on Sunday:




The UK has put more funding into the global search for a vaccine than any other country around the world.


Factcheck
Hancock was no doubt referring to the £210m UK donation to the Coalition for Vaccine Preparedness (CEPI), which is the largest single donation since the initiative announced a target of $2bn required from international governments to develop a Covid-19 vaccine.
However, the UK was starting from a lower base of funding to CEPI than other countries, including Japan, the US and Norway – whose total funding to CEPI now stands at nearly £340m. Beyond CEPI funding, it is unlikely that the UK is the biggest spender on the vaccine effort, with the US signing a single $456m deal with Janssen last month and the Gate Foundation announcing last week that it would spend “a few billion dollars” building factories for seven promising coronavirus vaccine candidates.

Video games to host Stay At Home, Save Lives message
","
The popularity of gaming is the latest tool being used to spread the government’s public health message and keep people indoors to help fight the coronavirus outbreak.
Players who are tackling some of the world’s favourite games – including Candy Crush Saga, Sniper Elite 4, DiRT Rally 2.0 and Farm Heroes Saga – will see the government’s message “Stay At Home, Save Lives” appear on their screens.
It is part of a joint effort by the government and some of the UK’s leading games companies to try and help stop the spread of coronavirus.
The government sees it as a “creative, targeted, and immediate” tool to try and reinforce its stay at home message to a generation of young people who are likely to spend more time playing video games than the rest of the population.
Approximately 37 million people in the UK play games, and there are around 2,277 active video game companies in the UK, according to the Culture Department.
Activision Blizzard, the leading interactive entertainment company, is inserting the “Stay At Home” message in its network of mobile games, including Candy Crush Saga.
The firm has also donated more than 230 “digital poster” advertising spaces in London, where it would normally promote its own products, for the public health messages.
Humam Sakhnini, president of King Digital Entertainment, said that allowing the messages to appear on Activision Blizzard is “a small part” in helping to deliver “vital” information.
He added: “Through our millions of players we’re able to assist Public Health England and the NHS spread their life saving message: stay at home, protect our NHS, and save lives.”

 'We're on our knees': NHS nurse pleads with public to stay indoors – video
Stay At Home posters are already featuring in Codemasters’ DiRT Rally 2.0, which has been played by millions of people since its February 2019 launch.
Codemasters, which is a video game developer and publisher, is also looking at ways to roll out more health messages in its games across Europe and the US in the coming weeks.
The Stay At Home message will also appear when players load up games produced by the firm Rebellion.
These messages may also link to relevant official government pages. Rebellion multimedia studios has also offered to advertise these messages in the comic books that it publishes.
Rebellion co-founder Jason Kingsley said: “We know how fundamentally beneficial video games, like Sniper Elite and Strange Brigade, and comics, like 2000 AD, have been and will continue to be for many of us during this extraordinary time.
“It makes total sense for us to help promote important public health messaging while keeping those fans entertained in the safety of their homes.”
Toby Evan-Jones, the vice president of business development at Codemasters, said: “We came to realise that technology within our games, which enables the remote updating of banners within the virtual environment, could be repurposed to assist with the coronavirus communication effort.”
He added: “It’s fantastic to see conversations already being sparked amongst our community.”
The government is inviting any company to contact them – at enquiriesculture.gov.uk – if they want to use in-game messaging in their products as part of the battle against coronavirus.

How readers play a vital role in shaping the Guardian's coronavirus content
","
Everyone is learning how to live, how to work (where possible and necessary), how to be safe and simply how to be during this extraordinary and troubling era of Covid-19.
The Guardian and Observer are learning too. With most staff working remotely – only a small number essential to producing the printed newspapers are in the London office – the highly collaborative task of journalism has been atomised and reshaped via new ways of liaising and rapid innovation around editorial technology.



A new approach to commissioning has been needed for every section of the newspaper. Sometimes more than once

The editor’s morning conference is now conducted via live streaming, press briefings are attended by teleconference, podcast presenters have swapped studio for home study, and live blogs are coordinated from kitchen tables. Where once a news editor could shout some breaking news or fresh instruction over the top of a computer, almost everything must be typed, all the right people kept in the loop.
The challenges are numerous but the consideration that goes into overcoming them will, I am certain, bring lasting benefit. In this, readers are as ever playing a vital role.
Some readers have, for instance, urged the removal of coronavirus articles that are overtaken by events. On the grounds of transparency, accountability and the integrity of the record, the Guardian’s policy is not to take down articles other than in the most exceptional circumstances. During a public health crisis, however, a responsibility to reader safety is essential. How is this best managed?
An early example of the issue came on Wednesday 18 March, when the travel desk published an article just ahead of Mother’s Day in the UK, recommending National Trust parks suitable for walks while social distancing. As fresh air and exercise were still encouraged, this piece was designed to steer people towards less crowded spots.
Three days later, the National Trust closed its parks and gardens after the government announced more stringent measures. For the best of motives, the article was deleted. Risk had been removed but so had something else. When the story of coronavirus comes to be told, to see how a parkland stroll was recommended on Wednesday but off-limits by Saturday will offer a glimpse into the extent of uncertainty in March 2020.
Scale this up across all reporting of a constantly evolving crisis – one in which national and international response will be scrutinised for clues to handling any future crisis – and you see why the chronicle matters.
Following discussion with senior staff, the National Trust feature was reinstated with prominent labelling and an amended headline. It meant a reader could not wander into the article on a misapprehension but neither had the Guardian hidden its own footsteps. This approach is now taken on a case-by-case basis when any potentially misleading Covid-19 article is identified.
The principle regarding removals also applies to rewrites. But every rule needs an exception and in exceptional times one has been made for Covid-19 “explainers”. These articles – some of which have received tens of millions of views – answer questions such as which symptoms require medical attention, when will a vaccine be ready and which countries have travel restrictions in place. To help readers find the most recent advice, some are regularly updated and republished to take account of new statistics, new information or new questions.
However, last week one reader asked anxiously whether a revised explainer meant something vital had been wrong in the original. Her question prompted internal discussion and there will now be a paragraph at the end of such pieces explaining the purpose of updates and that any significant corrections will be footnoted in the usual way.
Praise for the journalism has been terrific (“thorough, intelligent and filled with empathy”; “I’m relying on my online Guardian more than ever in lockdown”; “Thank you for all that you are continuing to do to get the paper out to us in this difficult time” – to give a flavour). But we hear, too, from readers asking for articles that will help them through the crisis.



Great-grandmother's secret to beating Covid-19… marmalade sandwiches

A new series called “Hope in a time of crisis“ responds to this shared feeling with doses of positive news, beginning on 4 April with the story of a 99-year-old woman who has recovered from coronavirus. It involves marmalade sandwiches. Elsewhere the coping coverage ranges from how pets are helping, readers’ tips on keeping fit and the Guide’s recently launched Staying In newsletter, while for complete distraction The antidote showcases five favourite reads that have nothing to do with Covid-19. This is also feels like an ideal time to direct readers to The Upside.
With lockdown affecting so much of life, a new approach to commissioning has been needed for every section of the newspaper. Sometimes more than once. Travel again demonstrates this journey. After non-essential movement was restricted on 23 March, coverage moved from outdoors to indoors: with virtual tours of museums, galleries and world landmarks, travel film recommendations and “postcards from the future” in which European writers dream of the places they will visit when the pandemic has passed.
As Andy Pietrasik, head of travel, says: “We want to give readers something to cheer them up, to remind them that normal life will one day return and all of the things they might do with it.”

Retired judge and Cummings' uncle Sir John Laws dies after contracting Covid-19
","
Sir John Laws, a retired senior judge and an uncle of the Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings, has died after contracting coronavirus, it has been reported.
Laws, 74, had been in hospital for three weeks with sepsis and other health problems. He was seriously ill and at first tested negative for coronavirus but subsequently contracted the virus and died on an isolated ward at Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London.
Laws was one of the UK’s leading authorities in public law and democracy, asserting the primacy of the constitution over parliament in the balance of power in Britain. He rose to become an appeal court judge after representing the government as first Treasury counsel followed by a period as a high court judge. After retirement from the bar he was elected a visiting professor of legal science at Cambridge University.

“John was the most gregarious of men, with a quick and lively wit, who enjoyed life in all its richness,” said Mark Hill QC, the chair of the Ecclesiastical Law Society. “A loyal and generous friend, he will be remembered for his love of Greece and of cats. Our thoughts are with his daughter, Margaret Grace, her husband and their two children, particularly at this difficult time of social isolation. May he rest in peace and rise in glory.”
Nigel Pleming QC, a good friend of Laws, said Laws’ daughter was able to see her father before he died, wearing full personal protective equipment.
“He was one of the greatest lawyers of his generation,” Pleming said of Laws.
Dinah Rose QC, one of the country’s leading barristers, said Laws was “one of the greatest advocates I’ve ever seen, and a man of enormous charm and erudition”.
Edward Henry QC remarked on the irony of Laws’ embodying “the judiciary’s expansionist philosophy” as it set him on “a collision course with government”. The government has recently indicated it wants to reduce powers of judicial review, which it believes have interfered with its decisions including over Brexit.

Laws, a brother of Cummings’ mother, grew up in Easington, County Durham, and studied at Durham School and Exeter College, Oxford.

US surgeon general warns of 'Pearl Harbor moment' as Americans face 'hardest week'
","
The US surgeon general warned the country on Sunday that it will face a “Pearl Harbor moment” in the next week, with an unprecedented numbers of coronavirus deaths expected coast to coast.

“The next week is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment. It’s going to be our 9/11 moment,” Jerome Adams told NBC News’ Meet the Press.
“It’s going to be the hardest moment for many Americans in their entire lives, and we really need to understand that if we want to flatten that curve and get through to the other side, everyone needs to do their part.”
Adams’s thoughts were echoed by Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s foremost infectious diseases expert.
“Things are going to get bad and we need to be prepared for that,” Fauci said on CBS’s Face the Nation. “It’s going to be shocking to some and it certainly is really disturbing to see that … Just buckle down.
“We’ve got to get through this week that is coming up because it’s going to be a bad week.”
Donald Trump issued a similar warning from the White House briefing room on Saturday.
“This will be probably the toughest week, between this week and next week,” he said. “And there will be a lot of death unfortunately.”
The president was hunkered in the White House on Sunday with no plans for a daily briefing, watching cable news and tweeting. He began the day by tweeting messages about the Palm Sunday holiday. At midday he tweeted praise for the Queen, who he described as “A great & wonderful woman!”
He also called PBS’s Yamiche Alcindor “a very biased journalist” and praised a Fox News commentator.
The US had recorded more than 312,000 confirmed cases and 8,500 deaths by Sunday morning, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.
New York state, the worst hit by far, recorded 594 deaths on Saturday – down from 630 deaths the day before, the first day-on-day decrease since the pandemic took off.
“The apex could be a plateau, and we could be on that plateau now,” New York governor Andrew Cuomo said, adding that the coming days would make clear which direction the state was headed. Overall 4,159 New Yorkers have died and there have been 122,031 confirmed cases, Cuomo said.
From Louisiana, a developing hotspot, Governor John Bel Edwards reiterated that his state was projected to run out of ventilators by Thursday and would reach intensive-care capacity two days after that.
As of Sunday, 477 people had died from Covid-19 in Louisiana, with well over half in the New Orleans metro area. New Orleans now has the highest per capita death rate of any city in the US, according to data analysis by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
“This is a tough emergency and it’s not different here than it is elsewhere,” Edwards told CNN’s State of the Union, confirming that 200 ventilators had arrived from the national stockpile on Saturday.
On Monday, Louisiana will open its first makeshift field hospital, at the Morial Convention Center in New Orleans. It will house 1,000 beds and, like other temporary sites in New York and elsewhere, is designed to ease the burden on city hospitals.
Senior infectious disease doctors, speaking to the Guardian last week, confirmed that hospitals in New Orleans have begun discussing the ethics of how to ration care should they become overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients.
As the crisis accelerates, five states have declined to issue stay-at-home orders: Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Arkansas. All have Republican governors.
On Sunday, Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson said there was no point issuing such an order because it would be ignored. “You have a stay-at-home order, tomorrow 600,000 Arkansans will still go to work,” Hutchinson said on NBC.
Fauci said states without stay-at-home orders were “putting themselves at risk”.
“I will not say we have it under control, that would be a false statement,” Fauci told CBS. “We are struggling to get it under control, and that’s the issue that’s at hand right now.” He said the rate of increase in new cases was slowing, an encouraging sign.
Adams, the surgeon general, urged people to stay at home no matter what rules are in place in their state.
“Ninety percent of Americans are doing their part, even in the states where they haven’t had a shelter in place [order],” Adams said. “But if you can’t give us 30 days, governors, give us a week, give us what you can, so that we don’t overwhelm our healthcare systems over this next week. And then let’s reassess at that point.”
Reaching again for imagery from the second world war, he added: “We want everyone to understand you’ve got to be Rosie the Riveter. You’ve got to do your part.”

Adams also advised people to wear masks or otherwise cover their mouths and noses when out in public, in addition to staying six feet apart.
“You need to make sure you’re not substituting social distancing with face masks,” he said.

Trump, 73, said on Friday he would not wear a mask despite such federal guidelines. “I don’t see it for myself,” he said, despite the fact that fatality rates are higher among older people.
His prospective opponent in the November election, Joe Biden, 77, said on Sunday he would wear a mask if he left his home in Wilmington, Delaware.
“Look, I think it’s important to follow the science, listen to the experts, do what they tell you,” Biden said. “[Trump] may not like how he looks in a mask but the truth of the matter is that – follow the science. That’s what they’re telling us.”

Market for Chinese-made masks is a madhouse, says broker
","
The scramble for face masks has created a “madhouse” atmosphere among Chinese manufacturers, who are making huge profits as customers around the world fight to be the first in line.
Producers of masks and respirators are demanding to be paid in full before the products leave their factories and are supplying whoever can pay the most and pay fastest, according to Michael Crotty, a textile broker based in Shanghai.
Crotty, of Golden Pacific Fashion and Design, said he had spent all of Sunday dealing with a flood of new enquiries from US states, national governments, cities, hospitals, distributors and private companies seeking to protect their employees.
“It’s just a madhouse,” he said. “Money talks. The factory knows one thing: what’s in my bank account and when did it get there? And if it gets there before the other guy then that’s who is going to get the production time.”
Factories that have quickly changed their production lines to make masks are demanding 50% payment when an order is made and the other 50% before the masks leave the factory. With scams proliferating, those are often unacceptable terms to many buyers, especially those spending taxpayers’ money.
“The factory doesn’t care,” Crotty said. “They’re getting orders from people they’ve never heard of before. It’s a really unusual circumstance to have these factories absolutely in the driver’s seat. And they’re in the driving seat not of a Volkswagen but of a Mercedes limousine.”
Wearing masks has long been common in parts of Asia to combat air pollution and the spread of disease, but until now was rare in Europe and the US.
The masks on the market range from thin cotton coverings to fine-mesh surgical masks and respirators that form a seal over the mouth and nose and have to conform to strict specifications.
Some European countries are weighing up whether to advise the public to wear masks when not at home. Last week the CDC in the US issued guidance recommending wearing a mask in public spaces. Trump has shrugged off the advice so far, saying: “This is voluntary. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.”
French and German officials blamed the US last week for using “wild west” tactics to outbid them, but Crotty said the outbidding appeared to be an all-against-all affair.
Over the weekend authorities in Berlin withdrew a claim that the US had “seized” a shipment of 200,000 respirator masks ordered for the city’s police force, a claim that led to an accusation of “modern piracy” from Berlin’s state interior minister, Andreas Geisel.
According to Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, the police now say they were outbid while the respirators were in transit at Bangkok airport. The Berlin authorities say it is unclear where they went and who the ultimate buyer was.
Der Tagesspiegel reported that the masks were made by the US manufacturer 3M, but it has denied any involvement in the transaction.

The company has come under intense public pressure from Trump in recent days for continuing to supply masks to other countries. On Thursday he invoked the Federal Production Act, which dates back to the Korean war era and has given the administration the right to use “any and all authority” to procure the protective equipment it needs.
“We need the masks. We don’t want other people getting it,” Trump said in a Saturday briefing to reporters. “That’s why we’re instituting [the] defence production act. You could call it retaliation because that’s what it is: it’s a retaliation. If people don’t give us what we need for our people, we’re going to be very tough.”
3M issued a statement on Friday saying that cutting off supplies of protective equipment to Canada and Latin America could cause a humanitarian crisis, but Trump stepped up his attacks on the company over the weekend.
“The people that have dealt with them, have dealt successfully with many companies over the last month, And they don’t like the way 3M has treated our country. They don’t frankly like the representatives of 3M,” he said.
Last week the US authorised the importation of respirator masks from China made to a Chinese standard that is close to US specifications for the N95, which filters at least 95% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger. (The European equivalent is the FFP2 respirator.)
At the same time, stung by widespread reports of shoddy masks imported from China, Beijing took action to regulate producers. However, Crotty said the effect of the regulation has been to cut off supply. Beijing is only giving certification to companies that have previously sold on the Chinese domestic market, but Crotty said four-fifth of the factories he dealt with manufacture solely for the export market.
“Only 20% might have these certificates, so of course they’re going to raise prices higher,” he said. But he added that masks without certification could still be exported if they were labelled for personal or commercial use only.
Crotty said everyone involved in the market was trying to improvise in unique circumstances. “None of us have ever seen anything like this. The reaction to the pandemic in the US was not very well prepared. So I think hopefully there’ll be big lessons learned through all of this, when this tapers off.”

Fauci: no evidence anti-malaria drug Trump pushes works against virus
","
Donald Trump’s top coronavirus adviser has warned again that there is no scientific evidence to support the use of an unproven anti-malaria drug the president has been pushing as a possible remedy for Covid-19.

In a rambling, hostile White House briefing on Saturday, Trump urged Americans worried about the virus to try hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria, arthritis and lupus that has not been extensively tested for other conditions.
“Take it. What do you have to lose?” the president said, suggesting that he might do so himself after asking “my doctors”.
But on Sunday Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top doctor on infectious diseases and a key member of the White House task force, was adamant there was nothing to suggest the medicine had any benefit against coronavirus.
“In terms of science, I don’t think we can definitively say it works,” he told CBS’s Face the Nation.
“The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there’s no effect.”
Dr James Phillips, professor of emergency medicine at George Washington University hospital, said Americans could be risking their health if they followed the president’s advice to take a drug for a condition for which it had not been tested.
“We don’t know enough to make medical recommendations,” he told CNN’s Reliable Sources.
“It’s a dangerous message for someone without a medical license to get up there and tell people to try it. You need to listen to physicians, people who understand science, before you go willy-nilly into the medicine cabinet.”
Fauci has been reluctant to directly criticise the president, with whom he speaks regularly, but has found himself repeatedly having to contradict the president over hydroxychloroquine, which has become a hobby horse at White House briefings.
On 21 March, the day after another nationally-televised Trump claim that the drug “looked promising”, Fauci was asked directly if it could be used to treat Covid-19.
“The answer is no,” he said.
Last month, a man in Arizona died after he and his wife took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is also found in hydroxychloroquine.
“Trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,” the man’s wife told NBC.
According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, by Sunday lunchtime around 313,000 cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed in the US and around 8,500 people had died.
Fauci did concur with White House messaging that a grim period lies ahead in the battle against the virus, and that the US is “struggling” to control the pandemic.
“This is going to be a bad week, unfortunately,” he said. “We need to be prepared that even though it’s clear mitigation is working, we’re still going to see … deaths.”
Fauci said there were glimmers of hope, but not things were due to get worse first.
“We should hope that within a week, maybe a little bit more, we’ll start to see a flattening out of the curve, and it coming down,” he said. “But the end result of that you don’t see for days, if not weeks down the pipe. Things are going to get bad and we need to prepare for that, it is going to be shocking to some.

“I will not say we have it under control, that would be a false statement, we are struggling to get it under control.”
Even after the crisis was over, Fauci warned, the possibility of a resurgence remained.
“Unless we get this globally under control there’s a very good chance it will assume a seasonal nature. It will unlikely be completely eradicated from the planet,” he said.
“That’s why we’re pushing so hard on getting our preparedness much better, pushing on a vaccine and doing clinical trials for therapeutic interventions so that hopefully if we do see that resurgence we will have interventions we did not have at the beginning of the situation we’re in right now.”

Policy backflip in lead-up to Queensland election puts youth in detention centres at risk of coronavirus
","
The population of Queensland’s youth detention centres has ballooned to near capacity amid a government-sponsored crime crackdown, prompting concern from human rights activists that vulnerable children are being placed at risk during the coronavirus outbreak.
The state’s human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, said without urgent attention, he thought it “inevitable” that children would again be “warehoused for prolonged periods” in police watch houses – a situation that provoked outcry about their treatment and prompted reforms of the youth justice system.

“Last year we saw children held in adult watch houses in some cases for weeks on end,” McDougall told Guardian Australia.
“On the present trajectory we are rapidly approaching the same situation and the Covid-19 pandemic brings another layer of complexity to this crisis.”
In 2018, Guardian Australia reported concerns about children being held in watch houses for extended periods due to overcrowded detention centres.
The ABC’s Four Corners program last year revealed that children as young as 10 had been housed in police custody alongside maximum security offenders.
The program prompted significant reform by the Queensland government and its approach was praised by human rights groups. It established a separate department for youth justice and announced initiatives to keep children out of detention and watch houses.
Last month the government made an about-face policy pivot: it announced a new “hard line on youth crime” approach that aimed to place more children in detention. This was partly a response to vocal campaigning by local media in Townsville, where Labor seats are considered vulnerable at this year’s state election.
In its announcement, the government said it would take “tougher action on bail” including seeking to keep more children on remand, and a “police blitz on bail” to appeal court decisions.
“These are changes our MPs in Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton and the Gold Coast have advocated and the government has acted,” the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said.
This week, there are 223 children in youth detention centres; significantly up from late last year, when the initial youth justice reforms were starting to take effect.
There are 258 youth detention beds in Queensland, but it is unclear whether these are all available, as ongoing expansion works at the Brisbane Youth Detention Centre had temporarily reduced its capacity, and these works are ongoing.
Human rights advocates with knowledge of Queensland’s youth detention system say the “safe” capacity of these centres is below the total bed numbers, as crowded facilities limit the ability of authorities to separate detainees of different ages and risk profiles.
Crowding is often also considered a contributing factor to incidents in youth detention centres. On 18 March, a disturbance occurred at the Townsville centre that involved three boys climbing on to the roof.
McDougall said the overwhelming majority of children in youth detention were from Aboriginal families, and many were accused of offences while living in unstable residential care arrangements.
“The situation calls for intensive resources to be made available to Aboriginal controlled organisations to assist the safe return of children to Aboriginal families and kinship carers. Aboriginal voices need to be heard in the process of finding creative solutions to this pressing crisis.”
Concerns about “hard line” policies disproportionately affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are heightened by the Covid-19 pandemic, and broad powers given to police to enforce public health regulations.
Amnesty International Indigenous rights campaigner Lidia Thorpe said detention often took children out of safe environments with family.
“Locking them up is putting them at more risk, given we’ve seen already this virus has got into prisons. Because of the overcrowding it puts kids or anyone at more risk of getting the virus.
“The safest place for these kids is at home.”

Thorpe was critical of the government’s youth crime shift, which she said fed into a narrative that promotes racist attitudes towards Aboriginal people.
“I think we have to keep in mind the Queensland election is coming up and unfortunately when we do have progressive governments in power, it becomes a race to the bottom on law and order. We’ve seen this around the country where we’ve had Labor governments in power.
“It’s wrong to suggest that when we see a child misbehaving that the best thing for that is to lock them up and isolate them. If this was happening to non-Aboriginal kids we would see an outrage in this nation, but [because] it’s happening to Aboriginal people it’s like it’s expected.”
The office of the state minister for child safety, youth and women, Di Farmer, said in March there were an average of seven young people a day held in police watch houses – down from 34 in March 2019 – and that the vast majority of those were waiting for a court hearing or processing.
“The average number of days spent in a Queensland police watch house since January 2020 was two days, which reflects the significant transport arrangements required for transfer from remote and regional communities,” a spokesman for the minister said.
“The government is investing $177m in new youth detention centres beds, which includes the expansion of Brisbane Youth Detention centre with 16 new beds due to come online in May, and construction of a new 32-bed youth detention centre at Wacol.
“This investment means state-wide capacity will increase from 258 beds to 306 beds by the end of this year.”

Australia's private health funds could reap windfall from coronavirus – report
","
Private health insurance funds stand to reap a windfall of between $3.5bn and $5.5bn due to a dramatic fall in elective surgery and other medical procedures during the coronavirus crisis, according to new research from The Australia Institute think tank.
Health expert Roy Harvey said that if the funds failed to pass on the dramatic fall in costs to customers, more people will flee a private health insurance system that is already in a death spiral.
Harvey, who worked with Australia Institute research director Rod Campbell on the report, said that if premiums were cut in line with services the federal government would also save $1bn to $1.5bn a year in subsidies.



'Like preparing for war': Australia's hospitals brace for coronavirus peak







Read more





The Australia Institute paper, “Private eyes ..., hips, etc”, models the effect on the funds if benefits paid to members drop by between 30% and 50% during a six-month period.
Factors taken into account include health minister Greg Hunt’s decision last week to pay at least $1.3bn to private hospitals to take over beds potentially needed to accommodate Covid-19 victims, and sweeping bans on dental services introduced by dentists.
Harvey said that many funds have abandoned premium hikes that were planned for this month, but this was not enough.
“They’ve been saying we won’t put through the 4% increase that they’re allowed to do in April, but if they say, ‘Oh, we’ll give you a 40% discount’, people might stay.
“If they keep their rates unchanged, people will leave in droves.”
The coronavirus pandemic has hit a private health industry that experts say was already in a “death spiral” because young people, who get relatively little from the product, have quit paying premiums.
This has left the funds with a membership increasingly weighted towards older people, who typically require more expensive medical procedures.
The escalating financial instability of the industry led the regulator to warn in February that only three will be viable in two years unless urgent action is taken.
“It sounds as if you’re not talking about a viable system or a product people want to buy,” Harvey said.
“The thing is unsustainable, it’s undermining the public hospital principle of equity and allowing doctors to charge fees that take people out of the public hospitals.”
He said it was hard to estimate the impact of the pandemic on private health using publicly available figures, but the $3.5bn to $5.5bn range was a good starting point.
“I think any detailed study would come up with figures that are in the range,” he said.
“Other people can say, ‘Oh, I think it’s this or that’, but it’s really to get a discussion started.
“The Productivity Commission could sort this out in less than a week in terms of getting good estimates.”
He said the funds should be held accountable for their windfall and money saved by the government could be used to fund other things, such as domestic violence services, that are needed during the pandemic.
“The savings to the commonwealth alone could be one to one and a half billion [dollars] – one and a half billion used to be a lot of money once,” he said.
Campbell said the insurers looked set to trouser their windfall billions.
“Insurers claim to be supporting their members through the crisis by delaying premium increases, but they should be passing on these significant savings to households,” he said.
“If the commonwealth does not ensure savings are passed on to customers, it will be one of the most egregious subsidies ever given to an industry already infamous for receiving handouts.”

In Australia, we are now seeing a sustained fall in the number of new Covid-19 cases per day.
This is also the case in New South Wales, the state where most of the cases in Australia have occurred. But some of the recently introduced restrictions appear more as a result of panicked political decisions rather than based on biological plausibility or evidence.
Our peak in new cases was around 25 March. Not long after, the numbers started falling and have continued to do so. This is very good news. It is much better than just flattening an epidemic curve. It’s turning around.
However, we are not yet out of the woods. This virus will invariably still be around and spread for months or even years to come. So, we will continue to have small numbers of cases that will persist and reappear as isolated cases and clusters. However, we are now in a better position to control these and stop further spread. We have very efficient public health investigative teams. By any international comparisons we already do a lot of testing – capabilities which are increasing.
The reason we had this fall is most likely due to what was put in place five to 10 days before the peak of the infections. This is because the average incubation period is five days. Therefore, whatever interventions you put in place to try to stop spread today, they cannot be expected at the earliest, to have any observed effects for at least five days.

So our fall in cases would appear to be mainly due to what where did previously – namely locking our international borders, quarantine of returned travellers and anybody who is a close contact of a known case, keeping people with infections isolated until we believe they’re no longer infectious etc.
In addition, we have stopped gatherings of people in most places, particularly indoors where infection is much more likely to spread. We have closed bars, clubs and restaurants. Social distancing has been taken up very vigorously by nearly all of us from what I can see in the streets, supermarkets, parks and in the workplace.
All those interventions when combined appear to have had a major effect and we are seeing the evidence of this in the fall in numbers of new cases.
What we’re not seeing however is evidence for what justifies the latest Victorian and NSW lockdown laws – and so hurriedly put into place.
These were instituted after we were already seeing falls in new case numbers. There is no evidence that I am aware of in Australia, or elsewhere, that if you are outside in the sunshine or open air and keep more than two metres away from other people, that you can acquire or give this virus to anyone else.
Despite this, people who sit on a park bench to have a rest or just watching the scenery are now threatened with fines or arrest in NSW and Victoria.
These overzealous new laws also give out a poor and very mixed message. If it’s deemed reasonably safe to be two metres apart in supermarkets and workplaces, how can this be wrong for people outdoors in our parks, beaches or in the countryside? What we need enforced is not people sitting on benches but these important distancing rules plus stopping groups from gathering – not a complete lockdown.
We need to temper our responses and restrictions based on the evidence we have and what is occurring in our communities. Any new rules must also have reasonable biological plausibility, lower transmission risks and be consistent with our main messaging. The latest responses from Victoria and NSW seem to fulfil none of those criteria.

We have probably been lucky so far in not having much community spread. A probable important factor was because we were in summer here and now autumn, when the virus was being spread worldwide. What we have mainly seen is infection in returned travellers and those from cruise ships. These reflect infections acquired elsewhere, and often in places where there has likely been spread for a couple of months already of unrecognised and wide community spread (e.g. Europe and the US).
This virus is unfortunately a problem we will have for at least six months and more likely for another 18 months to two years (when hopefully we will have a safe and effective vaccine).
Our upcoming winter will be our next major test. We need everyone to continue to comply with the rules we put in place mid-March and will likely need to do so until at least September.
Some states have now put in overzealous rules and ones that give very mixed messages or have little biological plausibility. Not only will this cause unwarranted and increased social, mental and economic harm, we run the bigger risk that a substantial part of our society in a few months’ time (our winter) might increasingly rebel against many restrictions.
I hope NSW and Victoria can be persuaded to relax on their overzealous restrictions so recently and unnecessarily put in place.

The Guardian view on internet access: life, death and learning
","
Even when our ability to spend and socialise has been curtailed in drastic ways, wealth and deprivation make themselves felt as potently as ever. Just as physical isolation is easier for those with warm, dry houses and spacious gardens than for those in cramped and run-down flats or hostels, so those with speedy broadband packages are now living more comfortably than those who rely on pay-as-you-go smartphones. The first group can shop online for groceries, work from home, video chat with ageing parents or take part in online classes. The second group may struggle. A few in the UK are not online at all.
The pandemic is underscoring the fact that internet access is no longer a luxury, but a necessity to participate in society fully. More than half the world’s population is now online. But access varies hugely according to the development level of countries, the wealth and education of individuals, and gender: fewer women than men use the internet. In some places, the ability to use a crucial source of information may be a matter of life and death right now (even if not all the information is reliable). Millions of people are actively denied access; Human Rights Watch has urged governments that have imposed shutdowns – such as Bangladesh and Myanmar – to lift them, warning that they could prove deadly given coronavirus’s spread.
In the UK, more than 90% of households have internet access of some kind, and those that don’t are generally distinguished by age or remote location rather than finances or gender. But “meaningful connectivity is about more than just access to the web ... to get the internet’s full benefits, people need regular access to a suitable device and enough data at sufficient speeds,” notes Tim Berners-Lee’s World Wide Web Foundation, which campaigns to increase access. The Office for National Statistics notes that a lack of digital skills can also be a significant barrier. Philip Alston, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, has warned of the perils of expanding reliance on digital technologies while many still lack good access. Universal credit is the first major service to become “digital by default”, with the application and most communications online – yet a minority of those on low incomes use broadband at home. With claims surging due to the lockdown, officials have been calling applicants to speed up matters.
The pandemic is a powerful reminder of the impact of the digital divide. It is building the case for treating internet access as a public utility: an essential service that needs to be properly regulated and buttressed by the state. In the UK, the government and major telecoms firms have agreed to remove data allowance caps on broadband services, avoid cutting off people who can’t pay bills and offer generous new mobile and landline packages, with more data at low prices or free calls. In the US, some providers have agreed to maintain service to those who fall behind on payments, while companies from Belgium to South Africa have upped data limits.
The World Wide Web Foundation has made other sensible recommendations, including zero-rating websites for official health organisations and other essential government services, so that they don’t draw from users’ data plans – ensuring access to the most important, and reliable, information. These are all good and positive steps. But they address a problem that has been highlighted and exacerbated by this crisis, not created by it. When the threat posed by coronavirus has ebbed, the digital divide will still need to be closed.

The Guardian view on Easter week: time to be creative
","
Last Thursday, millions of Britons stood for a second time on doorsteps and balconies, making their appreciation for frontline workers heard in cities, towns and villages. Clap for Carers began as an online call for applause, retweeted by NHS England. It seems destined to become a weekly national event: Thursday evening at 8pm has become a collective moment in which to show heartfelt admiration and solidarity. Many people will probably look forward to doing the same this Maundy Thursday.
This would be a worthwhile thing in itself. One of the major transformations in the life of a locked-down nation is the new anonymity of the days. The things which structured our daily lives – the bus journey to work; popping down to the canteen; stopping off at the supermarket to pick up dinner – have been erased. But many people have worked from home at one time or another. It is the long sweep of interchangeable days that is truly new. The weekend no longer carries the promise of a Friday night at the pub, a football match to go to, or a meal out. Sundays are no longer distinguishable from the rest of the seven-day pack. Churches are closed; sociable weekend lunches with friends are another furloughed pleasure, to be resumed with gusto at an unknown date. Coronavirus has flattened out time.
The new featurelessness is likely to be felt particularly acutely this week. Britain is a mainly secular country these days, albeit with significant religious minorities. But much of the nation still maps the contours of its year according to a Christian topography. For those who go to religious services regularly, shut churches on Good Friday – a day devoted to reflection on suffering and mortality – will feel particularly cruel in current circumstances. For the majority who don’t, bank holidays without the festive possibility of short breaks enjoying the sights of spring will be another strange landmark to add to a growing list.
Human beings need pattern, rhythm and variety to give shape and meaning to their time. In The Mirror and the Light, the gripping final instalment of Hilary Mantel’s Tudor trilogy, the author devotes considerable space to the Pilgrimage of Grace, the northern rebellion which was the largest to threaten the reign of Henry VIII. Among other grievances, the northerners objected to the proclamation restricting the number of holy days. The Henrician Reformation judged the old Catholic saints’ days and feast days to be a product of superstition as well as a good excuse for excessive drinking and carousing. The proclamation didn’t go down well. “They are asking for St Wilfried,” a courtier reports of the rebels in Mantel’s novel. “They want Giles and Swithin, and all the harvest saints. They would rather have a holiday than get the crops in.”
The Pilgrimage of Grace was brutally suppressed by Henry. For the time being, there is no prospect of relief from our own shapeless days. But the regular Thursday night applause, punctuating the middle of the week, perhaps offers a glimpse of a way forward. Many people are stoically attempting to conduct weekend dinner parties, drinks and parties online. Churches will offer virtual participation in services on Good Friday and Easter Sunday. Anything that gives an existential grammar to the passing days and weeks is a good idea. As for the coming weekend, Easter eggs are “not essential”, to use a phrase that has become overfamiliar over the past couple of weeks. But they will be deemed desirable by many, and they are definitely purchasable.

We need to protect all frontline workers
","
I am employed on mental health wards as a support worker, helping people recover from acute problems. It can be a very difficult but also very rewarding job. Covid-19 has not only affected general hospitals but has also had a huge impact on mental health facilities, which are more often run by a skeleton staff, as workers have had to self-isolate. On top of this we are also dealing with mental health patients infected with Covid-19, mostly with mild symptoms of the virus. As we are not considered to be on the frontline, we are not equipped with proper personal protective equipment. We get a basic face mask, gloves and a flimsy apron.
Last Tuesday I received a letter that said I should self-isolate even from my own family due to being in a high-risk group. I opened it on returning from a 13-hour shift on a ward where there were patients with suspected Covid-19 – wearing a basic face mask, gloves and apron. We waited three weeks for those masks. Their protection efficiency is 28%. Still, I regret nothing as those patients, many with severe mental health problems, need someone to look after them.
The letter came a bit too late. I did not expect it to come at all as I did not suspect I was in a high-risk group. I naively expected proper PPE. Now I can only count on my luck.Name and address supplied
• I read with interest and concern the letter from the parents of the trainee doctor and the letters about nurses (2 April). I am making a plea that, in among all the anger and frustration about the scandal that is the lack of PPE, we don’t forget social workers. My son is a social worker in child protection – working with some of the most vulnerable and at-risk young people in the UK. He is still compelled to do home visits that take him into unregulated environments. His last visit was to a small two-bedroom flat in an impoverished part of London, housing a family of seven. Two members of the household sleep in the living room where the meeting took place. He has been given no advice (even after asking for it), no protection protocols and no PPE.
This is a further scandal of neglect. We are too ready to make social workers the perennial scapegoats when things go wrong. Please let’s not ignore them now when they are looking after those young people most at risk. If children are all of our future, then we must support those who care for them on our behalf – emotionally and practically. All frontline workers should have PPE.Name and address supplied
• It’s good that you draw attention to the crisis in care homes (UK care home staff ‘at breaking point’ as coronavirus cases rise, 31 March), but very little attention is given anywhere in the media to carers, like my daughter, who are not attached to care homes but spend all the unsociable hours God sends visiting older people in their own homes, carrying out very intimate and personal tasks without any protective equipment except their usual gloves and hand gel. And I won’t mention the rates of pay, the zero-hours contracts and the worry about what happens if they become ill, financially and in relation to the risks of cross-infection.Maureen StephensonShilbottle, Northumberland
• Much has been made of the tragic deaths of doctors and nurses from Covid-19, but very little of those of other healthcare professionals. Two healthcare assistants have succumbed to the illness (Coronavirus deaths of two nurses lead to calls for more protection, 3 April). Healthcare is multidisciplinary. The least well remunerated have the most frequent, intimate and currently dangerous contact with patients. Their passing should be better acknowledged.Will GelsonStapleford, Cambridgeshire

Who will lead us through these troubled times?
","
Gaby Hinsliff is absolutely right to raise parallels with the 1914-16 Asquith war government and our own parlous situation under our current political leadership (Doctors and nurses are dying for lack of equipment. Is Johnson up to this?, 2 April). At that time, an intelligent but lazy prime minister with a complicated love life, renowned for deferring difficult decisions, was accused by the press and sections of his own party – as well opposition politicians – of inaction and drift. It seemed obvious that a collective national action plan, involving all sectors of industry and the body politic, was urgently needed if the country were to avoid a national catastrophe. Comparisons with Germany’s far better state of preparedness were added to charges of incompetence levelled at the prime minister at that time of national crisis.
Unfortunately, today we seem to lack a Lloyd George – a man of energy and wide popularity, commanding the respect of all sides of the house and the country, and seen by friend and foe alike as the only man with the necessary will and gravitas, as well as a brutal willingness to abandon a former friend and colleague, to lead us through these dark times. Unless, of course, the present chancellor of the exchequer, like his predecessor Lloyd George, at some point decides there is no alternative but to knife his friend the PM in the back. To emulate Lloyd George, Rishi Sunak would need to get the new leader of the opposition on board and, preferably, sitting with him in a new government of national unity. That prospect might seem improbable now but, as this crisis unfolds, who knows? Stranger things have happened.Greg DelaneyChiswick, London
• I quote from Lytton Strachey’s Eminent Victorians (1918), on what greeted Florence Nightingale at Scutari. “What had occurred was, in brief, the complete breakdown of our medical arrangements at the seat of war. The origins of this awful failure were complex and manifold; they stretched back through long years of peace and carelessness in England; they could be traced through endless ramifications of administrative incapacity – from the inherent faults of confused systems, to the petty bunglings of minor officials, from the inevitable ignorance of Cabinet Ministers to the fatal exactitudes of narrow routine.”
I notice Sir Keir Starmer has chosen his words carefully in saying he will work with Boris Johnson; this does not imply unconditional support.Anne AllisonLondon

A lesson from Italy: it's all or nothing
","
I have sympathy for police forces who have been under fire for what some see as overzealous interpretations of the lockdown rules. Covid-19 is so contagious that I believe an all-or-nothing crackdown is the only one that works, and I am disappointed that the media continue to use words like “draconian” (Sunshine on way to UK but health officials stress: stay home, 2 April).
I live in Italy and can be fined €1,000 or slung in jail for up to three months if I leave my village without good reason. The UK, unlike Italy, had the benefit of studying precedents and could have locked down from the start. I predict that in a week or two everyone with any concept of self-preservation in the UK will be safely cowering behind their doors – including those bleating about the erosion of their freedoms – while only brave hospital staff, carers, emergency service workers, volunteers and public servants will be out risking their lives to help the many.
Florence Nightingale knew about zero tolerance when it came to the spread of disease. The government should listen to her words: “To be ‘in charge’ is certainly not only to carry out the proper measures yourself, but to see that everyone else does too.”Marika McGregorCorinaldo, Italy

While I applaud Jordan Henderson’s efforts (Jordan Henderson setting up Premier League coronavirus fund for NHS, 3 April), perhaps when we get to the other side of this crisis he might consider supporting a substantial increase in higher-rate taxes, which might go some way to ensuring that in future the NHS and care workers are not reliant on the generosity of socially conscious footballers.Brian WoollandSalisbury, Wiltshire

Coronavirus latest: at a glance
","
Key developments in the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday include:
Italy reports lowest increase in deaths in two weeks
The country registered 525 new coronavirus deaths on Sunday, the lowest daily rate in the last two weeks. For the first time, the total number of people hospitalised fell in a day, from 29,010 to 28,949.
Ethiopia and Barbados reports first coronavirus deaths
Ethiopia has announced the first death of a patient with coronavirus. The health ministry said the patient was a 60-year-old Ethiopian woman who had spent six days in intensive care. Barbados reported the death of an 81-year-old man who had an underlying medical condition and who had travelled to the UK.
Scottish chief medical officer steps down from media briefings
Scotland’s chief medical officer is withdrawing from daily media briefings during the pandemic after it was revealed she had twice visited her family’s second home. Catherine Calderwood will remain in the post and continue advising the Scottish government but will step back from public roles.
Pakistan quarantines 20,000 worshippers
Pakistan has quarantined 20,000 worshippers and is looking for tens of thousands of others who attended a religious event in Lahore in March despite the pandemic. Authorities said they want to test or quarantine 100,000 people who were at the event held by the Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic missionary movement, between 10 and 12 March.
Lebanon begins repatriation of stranded nationals
Lebanon has begun repatriating nationals in its first flights in weeks since it closed its international airport in response to the pandemic. Authorities said more than 20,000 people had signed up to be repatriated this week or at the end of the month.
Pope urges recognition of ‘the real heroes’ during pandemic
Pope Francis has celebrated Palm Sunday mass without the public because of the pandemic, which he said should focus people’s attention on what’s most important. Normally, tens of thousands would have gathered for an outdoor mass, but this year the pontiff celebrated without the crowds and inside St Peter’s Basilica.
Austria reports more recoveries than new cases
The number of new cases rose by 270 from the previous morning, while the number of recoveries increased by 491, according to the health ministry. Authorities said the daily rate of new infections has fallen significantly in recent days.
Sweden prepares to take ‘extraordinary steps’
The government is drawing up legislation to allow it to take “extraordinary steps” to tackle Covid-19, following concern that its relatively soft approach may be resulting in a higher death rate than in other Nordic countries. On Sunday Sweden reported a total of 401 deaths – an 8% increase from Saturday. Sweden’s toll per million inhabitants is 37, compared with 28 in Denmark, 12 in Norway and 4.5 in Finland.
Belgium is reaching pandemic’s peak
The outbreak in the country is appearing to be reaching its peak, according to reports, after the number of intensive care hospitalisations rose from 1,245 to 1,261.
Singapore records 60% increase in cases over 24 hours
The county reported 120 new cases of the virus on Sunday, compared with 75 on Saturday. It was the most infections confirmed in a day for the city state, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,309.

Ex-astronaut launches training kit for coping with self-isolation
","
Perhaps your flatmate has polished off the last beer in the fridge, diverging tastes in Netflix series have led to simmering tensions, or parental negotiations over home-schooling have descended into hostility.
Life in lockdown can fuel family tensions, sour friendships and drive a wedge between new romantic partners who have opted to self-isolate together. Help is on hand, however.
A former Nasa astronaut, Jay Buckey, has launched an online self-help toolkit aimed at replicating the kind of training designed to help astronauts cope with confinement in small spaces for extended periods.
“It’s challenging to be isolated with a small group of people and to not be able to get away,” said Buckey, who flew on a 16-day Space Shuttle Columbia mission that orbited the Earth 256 times. “Outer space and your own living room might be drastically different physically, but emotionally the stressors can be the same.”
The online training, called the Dartmouth Path Program, was developed to determine how the space programme can manage pressures brought on by long-duration spaceflight. It is already being tested in extreme environments such as research stations in Antarctica, but since social distancing restrictions came into force it has been made freely available to the public online.
It includes training on conflict resolution, mood management and self-assessment tools to be able to monitor signs of anxiety and stress.
For stress, the programme prompts the participant to consider whether they could be over-reacting, catastrophising or making judgments that don’t fit the evidence. Focused breathing and muscle relaxation techniques are outlined for when you are feeling anxious or angry.
The training also covers depression, which can set in when you feel restricted and unable to do the things that normally boost your mood, according to Buckey, who is now a professor of medicine at Dartmouth College.
The programme encourages people to select problems and find aspects they can improve or solve and to brainstorm positive steps they can take. It encourages people to think about a single enjoyable activity that is possible to do each day. “If you focus constantly on what you can’t do or things you want to do or that you’re isolated, that’s not good for mood,” said Buckey.
Keeping a balance between group time and private time is crucial, he said. “You need to allow people their privacy but not to allow them to become isolated and separated from a group,” he said. “If someone’s spending all their time in their room with their door closed, that’s not great. Forcing people to take part in group activities that they’re just not into – that’s not good either.”
According to Buckey, Nasa and other agencies now give psychological training to avoid conflict between crew members, but the problem blighted some missions in the past. The Russian cosmonaut Valentin Lebvedev, who documented his 211-day stay onboard the Space Station Salyut 7 with Anatoly Berezovoy, wrote: “We don’t understand what’s going on with us. We silently walk by each other, feeling offended. We have to find some way to make things better.”
Scientists on Antarctic missions have also struggled with isolation, Buckey said, pointing to the notes of Jean Rivolier, a French psychologist and chief doctor on several Antarctic expeditions, describing the dismal morale of one party in the 1990s.
“One subject returned early to Sydney on psychological grounds, because he was homesick for his family and he became progressively more depressed,” Rivolier wrote. “When the others returned they were humourless, tired, despondent and resentful. None had found the Antarctic experience to be enjoyable, not so much from any rigours of the climate, terrain or personal hardships as from inconsiderate and selfish behaviour.”
Pete Davis, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, said the uncertain length of missions to the south pole, due to weather considerations, was challenging. The “worst thing to do”, he said, was to focus on when isolation would end. “The best thing to avoid is what’s going to happen in three months time when you’ve only just started,” he said. “All you can control is what’s going to happen today or tomorrow.”

Davis, who returned from a three-month Antarctic mission in February only to be plunged back into confinement at home, advised that simple, considerate gestures could help ensure harmony.
“In Antarctica, full-blown conflict doesn’t tend to happen, but the small niggle of ‘that’s so annoying’ does,” he said. “Just things like if you’re going to make a cup of tea, make sure you ask everyone as well. It’s such a minor thing but it can get under people’s skin.”

London bus drivers 'scared to death' by lack of virus protection
","
London bus drivers mourning the loss of five colleagues are “scared to death” of catching coronavirus and still do not have full hygiene measures in place, their union has warned.
Drivers still do not have access to sanitising wipes and many driver cabins have yet to be fitted with protective Perspex boxes, the Unite union said on Sunday.
After the deaths of three bus drivers and two bus controllers in the capital, a public health expert has also called for all staff driving buses across the UK to be given face masks.
Unite’s regional officer for London bus workers, John Murphy, said the deaths of his colleagues had “terrorised” his 24,000-strong membership, particularly those driving buses.
“What has happened has scared them to death and terrorised the drivers. I have been a driver on London buses for 24 years and I can tell you that we are a family. What has happened to our colleagues hits us all,” he said.

Murphy said that as of last Wednesday all of London’s 80 bus garages had procured hand gel for drivers and other staff. The problem, Murphy said, was that there was a lack of sanitising wipes that drivers could use both in the garage and out on journeys with the public.
“Unite, working with Transport for London and the bus companies, have managed to secure plenty of hand gel – but what we are waiting for are the sanitising wipes,” he said. “There appears to be a big shortage of wipes and they are needed. I understand that because production is dramatically down and factories are closing there is a real shortage, but we are calling on Transport for London to seek a new source for them as soon as possible.”
The former bus driver stressed that every bus on London’s streets and roads was now deep cleaned overnight before it left the garage, but said he was calling on both TfL and the bus companies to allow Unite shop stewards access to any deep clean that took place, if members requested it, to reassure bus workers that the vehicles had been properly cleaned.
Murphy said the installation of protective Perspex booths was “still on a rolling basis” and not all buses on the road were fitted with them.
“Given that the fleet is running on reduced services, perhaps Transport for London could fit the buses not in use with the booths so that drivers on every route still operating will be behind Perspex as soon as possible,” he added.
Dr John Ashton, a public health expert who is currently advising the Bahraini government on its response to the Covid-19 crisis, said it was essential that bus drivers wear masks as well as working behind protective screens.
The former regional director of public health in Northwest England said: “Really the bus drivers and indeed public transport workers should be afforded the same protection as NHS staff. That means they should be given face masks and all should be tested for the virus. This is so obvious. They are public servants working day in day out with the public and they need everything at their disposal to protect themselves and those they come into contact with.”

Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said he was “absolutely devastated” by the news of the bus workers’ deaths. He promised to bring in further measures to ensure higher levels of protection across the London transport system.
Khan said: “I have been clear that our incredible public transport staff, on the buses, tubes, trams and trains, are critical workers, making a heroic effort to allow our NHS staff to save more lives.
“But we all need to play our part too, and that means fewer Londoners using the public transport network.”

Coronavirus Rhapsody: isolation is catalyst for slew of parody songs
","
From a family in Kent reworking a Les Miserables song to Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody being turned into an ode to coping with Covid-19, self-isolation is proving the catalyst for a new breed of homemade viral songwriting.
The Marsh family’s interpretation of One Day More clocked up 1.4m views, and made them internet stars with the lyrics (for example: “Our grandparents are miles away / they can’t work Skype, we’re brokenhearted”) being reworked to reference life during lockdown.
Adrian Grimes and Dana Jay Bein’s version of Queen’s classic has clocked up 3.5m views, and turns it into “bleak pastiche” of the song with lines such as “I’m just a young boy, no job security”. Both the songs share a dark sense of humour, are instantly recognisable to millions and have found an audience around the world.
The latest song to go viral is from a group of Chicago-based stand-up comedians who shot a lo-fi video inspired by this year’s Icelandic entry to Eurovision, Daði Freyr’s Think About Things.

Garrett Williams and his housemates shot the video in two hours, edited it over a similar amount of time and then posted the results on Twitter – the video attracted more than 5m views within 24 hours of its release.
“My roommate sent me the song and we were like ‘this song slaps’,” said Williams. “From there we were dancing to it and thought this could be a fun video, we made some suggestions for dance moves and outfits and put it all together.”
The method behind such a huge viral hit is surprisingly simple, according to Williams. He explained that the idea from the Michel Gondry-esque music video came from listening to the song and idly dancing before leaving the house to buy food.
“We were waiting to go pick up food or go to the store together and we started to play the song and one of us was bouncing,” he said. “From that we thought ‘oh let’s just make a video where everyone is bouncing the whole time’. That’s it.”
Williams says he has had friends who have found work in comedy off the back of viral videos and usually timing posts to launch when your audience is largest is a key part of success. However, in lockdown conditions, Williams says there is a new captive audience at almost any time of day, thirsty for brazenly uplifting content.
“In our sphere there’s a lot of talk about the best time to post,” he said. “But now everyone is at home no one has any idea about when the best time to post is. I sat on it for a day, and then my friends said just go for it, post it. So I did and it’s blown up in 24 hours.”
Another motivation for Williams, Grimes and the Marsh family was to stay occupied while in isolation, with Williams saying the video “filled the void” of not having work to be busy with.
“Our group likes to be on the go, we’re always doing shows and trying to keep busy with work,” he said. “With the quarantine situation we haven’t had a project, so last week we had a couple of ideas floating around and made this one.”
There has been some negative reaction to the songs, particularly Grimes’ cover of Bohemian Rhapsody. Grimes addressed criticism of the song’s lyrics such as “Mama, I just killed a man / I didn’t stay inside in bed / I walked past him, now he’s dead,” which were branded insensitive.

He explained that his wife was involved in healthcare and so he was aware of the impact Covid-19 was having on people. Grimes encouraged people to maintain their sense of humour and said he had also received many “comments from people already affected by coronavirus have told me how much they appreciate this”.
Williams thinks the parody videos are proving so popular but people were looking for something fun to distract themselves during isolation and also spending more time online.
“At this time when there is a lot of bleak news, and really heavy stuff coming through people are looking for something that they can disassociate to,” he said. “Something that people can say ‘oh, this is fun’. We can still have fun and not have to be so scared all the time about everything.”
