US officials have stopped nearly three million specialized masks from being exported to Canada’s most populous province, amid mounting fears that Ontario will run out of supplies for medical staff battling coronavirus by the end of the week.
Donald Trump on Friday invoked the 1950 Defense Production Act giving the government “any or all authority” to stop 3M exporting N95 respirators to Canada and Latin America
The masks, which filter out 95% of airborne particles, are seen as a critical tool for frontline healthcare workers in the fight against Covid-19.

But as supply shrinks, countries and local governments are locked in a desperate battle to access whatever equipment is available.
At a press conference on Monday, Ontario premier Doug Ford said the 500,000 masks had been cleared for release, but nearly three million masks were intercepted by US officials at 3M’s South Dakota Facility.
“We know that the US isn’t allowing supplies across the US border,” Ford said. “The hard truth is, our supplies in Ontario are getting very low and the more new cases we get, the more demand there is on our resources.”
3M initially resisted the president’s executive order, warning in a statement the move would have “significant humanitarian implications” for countries desperate for safety equipment.
Over the weekend, Trump harshly criticised the company, warning it would have “a big price to pay”.
“We need the masks. We don’t want other people getting it,” Trump said in a Saturday briefing to reporters. “That’s why we’re instituting [the] defence production act. You could call it retaliation because that’s what it is: it’s a retaliation. If people don’t give us what we need for our people, we’re going to be very tough.”
3M has not directly responded to the president’s remarks or say whether it intended to continue exports of protective equipment. But it issued a statement on Sunday saying it would “continue to maximize the amount of respirators we can produce for heroic healthcare workers in the US and worldwide”.
As Ontario scrambles to source new equipment, Ford said the province is “desperately” counting on orders placed through the federal government’s bulk purchasing program to bridge its short-term needs until a sustainable supply can be found.
The order from Trump has come as a blow to Canadians, many of whom prize the close relationship between the two countries.
Speaking at his daily press briefing on Monday, Justin Trudeau said his government wouldn’t implement retaliatory measures, instead relying on diplomacy to end the impasse.
“There are very productive conversations ongoing and we expect those shipments to be delivered,” said the prime minister.
Trudeau said foreign minister François-Philippe Champagne had spoken earlierwith US secretary of state Mike Pompeo – but declined to provide additional details about the halted shipment.

A US readout from the call said Pompeo “reiterated the United States’ desire to work with Canada” to ensure Canada had access to critical equipment while also hard-hit areas in the US from having a supply of equipment.
But Trudeau also cautioned Canada’s relationship with the United States is a “two way street” – a reference to the hundreds of healthcare workers in southern Ontario that cross into Michigan each day.
In addition to front line workers, Canada also supplies American companies with the primary materials needed to construct the specialized equipment, including a medical-grade fabric at a pulp mill in British Columbia. The mill, Harmac Pacific, said it had no plans to halt exports to the United States.
Despite the prime minister’s promise of a resolution with his American counterparts, provincial leaders are already looking to the future.
Quebec-based AMD Medicom Inc recently signed a deal to manufacture as many as 50 million surgical and N95 masks for the federal government, according to the Globe and Mail. And in Ontario, premier Ford said he was working with federal officials to expedite the approvals process for a new N96 mask developed by within the province.
“Never again in the history of Canada should we ever be beholden to countries around the world or companies around the world for the safety and well-being for the people of Canada,” Ford said Friday. ”I’m not going to rely on President Trump, I’m not going to rely on any prime minister or president from any country ever again.”

Doctors are being “bullied and shamed” into treating patients with Covid-19 despite not having the masks, gowns and eyewear they need to protect themselves from the virus, frontline medics have said.
Others are being told to hold their breath to avoid getting infected because of persistent shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) .
The findings raise questions about how far a huge effort by NHS bosses, ministers and the military have succeeded in banishing previously widespread supply problems with PPE.
“Lack of personal protective equipment continues to be a critical issue. It is heartbreaking to hear that some staff have been told to simply ‘hold their breath’ due to lack of masks,” said Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, the president of the Doctors’ Association UK (DAUK).
“Doctors are dying. Nurses are dying. We are devastated, and can no longer stand by and watch as more dedicated colleagues lose their life,” she said.
At least three NHS doctors, two nurses and one midwife have died already after contracting coronavirus.
The DAUK has begun collating anonymous reports from its network of frontline medics about continuing shortages of PPE, which has created confusion, alarm and fear among staff. It has developed an app with a firm called Messly to log shortages.
Based on 500 reports so far from 193 hospital trusts and GP practices, the DAUK says that:
72% of doctors cannot get hold of an FFP3 mask when they need one.
77% report shortages of long-sleeved gowns.
43% cannot always use a visor or goggles when they need them.
The findings also indicate that protective kit is still in short supply for doctors undertaking “aerosol generating procedures” on Covid-19 patients, such as intubating them, where potentially dangerous droplets are expelled from their mouths.
Almost half (49%) of medics performing such procedures cannot always access a gown, 42% an FFP3 mask and 20% proper eye protection, DAUK found.
However, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) said a combination of revised PPE guidance issued last week by Public Health England and the NHS drive to get millions more pieces of kit to the frontline had made a big impact on the shortages and helped allay staff’s fears.
“Things are much better than they were a week ago. People on the ground are saying that it’s getting better, though there are still some distribution issues within hospitals,” said Dr Andrew Goddard, the president of the RCP, which represents mainly hospital doctors in England.
Public Health England’s “much clearer” new advice had helped banish the “confusion” many staff felt about what PPE they should wear in certain medical settings in order to reduce their risk, he added.
“In a survey we ran last week 22% of staff said they didn’t have access to the PPE they needed. That is adding to the anxiety and emotional challenge of working in these settings, as working on Covid wards is a scary situation. That 22% needs to become 0% as soon as possible,” he said.
Twickenham MP Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokesperson, said: “It is absolutely shocking to hear from medical professionals about the risks they are having to take in providing care for our loved ones and the fear they have of speaking up regarding the availability of appropriate PPE.
“Despite promises from ministers, it’s clear that our frontline health and care workforce still do not have adequate supplies of the correct protective equipment. It is simply unacceptable that so many staff feel they are being put in harm’s way due to shortages of essential kit, in turn risking the health of their loved ones and other patients. They should not need to rely on crowdfunding, donations from schools and makeshift visors to do these critical roles.”

 Rolls-Royce's self-reliance has given the chancellor a boost ","
Rishi Sunak will be delighted. The chancellor told the aviation industry that government-backed bailouts would only be considered “as a last resort”, and here comes engine-maker Rolls-Royce to demonstrate what it can achieve under its own steam.
Rolls’ shareholders should also be pleased. Monday’s dividend suspension is bad news for them, but not half as bad as a rights issue would have been. The latter was avoided (at least for now). Instead, investors got a reassuring display of the company’s ability to absorb financial pain by borrowing more and spending less.
Rolls has drawn down one £2.5bn credit facility and secured a £1.5bn one on top, bringing its overall liquidity to £6.7bn. The cash drag in the other direction is severe, which is only to be expected given that Rolls collected £3.9bn in 2019 via “engine flying hours” (EFH) contracts. With so many planes not flying, the plunge in the EFH line in March was 50%; April’s rate will be worse.

Thank you for your feedback.

Add it all up, though, and City analysts reckon any financial crisis at Rolls would not appear until the autumn. Remember that two smaller divisions – defence and power systems – are carrying on as normal. And Rolls reckons it can ease its cashflows by £750m this year by cutting spending, not paying a dividend and forcing a temporary 10% pay cut on workers.
The big unknown, of course, is how long airplane fleets will be grounded around the world, and how quickly life will return to normal thereafter. That remains anyone’s guess, and the Rolls chief executive, Warren East, wisely didn’t offer a forecast. But the 18% bounce in the share price tells the story: self-help can keep Rolls’ engine ticking over for a while.
Debenhams puts a brave face on lockdown administration
They’re an optimistic bunch at Debenhams. As the department store chain headed for administration for the second time within 12 months, management whistled about how lenders are supportive and how normal trading will resume when shoppers are allowed to return to high streets. This latest administration is of the “light touch” variety, apparently, and merely designed to forestall legal action from creditors.
One doubts if Debenhams’ suppliers will feel so relaxed since, unlike the last administration, they probably won’t be paid in full this time. Yet, strange as it may sound, Debenhams probably will live to fight another day.
Most of the 22,000 staff can be put on the government’s furlough scheme; and, since even mighty Primark isn’t paying its rent, landlords can be told to go whistle for a few months. After another cull of its stores, Debenhams should emerge in vaguely recognisable form.
Do not mistake survival for prosperity, however. This is more akin to an exercise in financial damage limitation for Silver Point Capital, the US hedge fund now in control of Debenhams. Covid-19 is a huge setback for its plans, but the hedgies need to roll the dice again, keep the business alive and hope something turns up.
Legal & General’s divi isn’t as risky as it seems
As a former Treasury high-flyer, Sir John Kingman knows how to read regulatory breezes. So one suspects Legal & General, where he is chairman, is in the clear on its decision to keep paying a dividend.
The Bank of England’s advice to insurers last week was merely to ensure distributions are “prudent and consistent with … risk appetite”. That was a long way from being an outright ban, as was applied to banks. So, as long as it’s being prudent, L&G should be fine.
And, yes, L&G is being conservative by most measures. Its last solvency reading was healthy. A large chunk of its business these days is fund management, which doesn’t consume vast sums of capital. And its book of annuities is backed by steady long-life assets.
What’s more, there’s a fair argument that putting cash into the hands of investors serves a wider purpose. The money can be recycled and used for rescue fundraisings elsewhere. L&G and Kingman run the risk of being embarrassed if the market shakeout becomes substantially worse, hitting key ratios. But saving the divi looks the right move for now. Someone’s got to give the pension funds some income.

As the death toll from coronavirus in the US climbed toward 10,000, a New York City official warned it could establish temporary burial grounds in city parks and new polling showed an erosion in public trust in Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis.

Confirmed cases in the US were approaching 340,000 as of Monday morning, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The death toll stood at 9,650.
Many hospitals across the US were at capacity, and new hotspots or potential hotspots were springing up in every region. Maps of confirmed cases showed clusters from Atlanta to Nashville to Indianapolis – wherever there was a population center.
Trump on Monday morning tweeted “USA strong!” and “Light at the end of the tunnel!” in all capital letters.
But new polling by the Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida indicated that voters in the key presidential election battleground state have lost trust in the president. A 53% majority of Floridians in the poll disapproved of Trump’s handling of the crisis, and 58% said they did not trust Trump “to provide reliable information about the coronavirus”.
Top administration officials issued a coordinated message at the weekend that the US was facing difficult weeks ahead.
“This is probably going to be a very bad week,” Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s foremost infectious diseases expert, said.
In New York City, the chair of the city council’s health committee warned the morgues were almost full.
“Soon we’ll start ‘temporary interment’,” the councilman, Mark Levine, tweeted. “This likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials (yes you read that right). Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line. It will be done in a dignified, orderly – and temporary – manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take.”
Levine later said the plan had not yet been put into motion. Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters: “We will have the capacity for temporary burials – that’s all I’m going to say.
“I’m not going into details. I don’t think it’s a great thing to be talking about.”
In the state capital, Albany, Andrew Cuomo distanced himself from the idea, saying he would not support such plans.
Cuomo, the New York state governor, reported that the coronavirus death toll in the worst hit US state had risen to 4,758 from around 131,000 cases, but added that the daily total of deaths had been “effectively flat for two days”, representing a “possible flattening of the curve” and an apex of the New York outbreak.
“If we are plateauing, it is because social distancing is working,” Cuomo said, announcing an extension of the “New York pause” social-distancing guidelines to 29 April, which means schools and non-essential businesses must stay closed until that date.

 Andrew Cuomo doubles fines as New Yorkers flout 'stay at home' orders – video
The governor also announced an increase in fines for not observing social distancing and spoke insistently about New Yorkers’ duty to each other and to frontline healthcare professionals.
Cuomo said the state government was applying to the Trump administration to have the USNS Comfort, a US navy medical ship docked in New York, converted to taking Covid-19 patients. The temporary hospital set up by the army at the Javits convention centre in Manhattan has already been switched to coronavirus cases.
Cuomo also reported “anecdotal suggestions” that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug championed by Trump, was proving effective in clinical trials in the city. But he said definitive answers on the drug’s use in coronavirus cases was “weeks if not months” away.
Cuomo also said the New York healthcare system was operating at full stretch but did not for now need any more ventilators, key machines for people badly affected by the respiratory disease.
“The people we lost are the people we couldn’t save,” he said.
As states continued their struggle to obtain ventilators and other life-saving medical equipment, California governor Gavin Newsom, whose state had some success at fighting off an early wave of the epidemic, said California would loan 500 “state-ownded ventilators” to other states.
“It’s more important than ever we are the UNITED States of America,” Newsom tweeted. “I know, if the tables were turned, other states would be there for us.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed tentatively in morning trading, but with millions filing for unemployment each week, a former chair of the federal reserve said the economy could sink into depression.
“This is a huge, unprecedented, devastating hit, and my hope is that we will get back to business as quickly as possible,” former chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen told CNBC.
But she said the unemployment rate likely was as high as 13% and gross domestic product was down at least 30%.

Like pacesetters in a deadly long-distance race, Italy and Spain have for weeks charted new and frightening territory, as the coronavirus pandemic grips Europe. Citizens have watched in anguish, as daily death tolls climbed close to a thousand and hospitals were overwhelmed. At the weekend, nearly a month after Rome and Madrid imposed national lockdowns, the first glimmerings of a reward for an unprecedented period of collective self-restraint were visible. In Italy, Sunday’s reported death toll of 525 was the smallest daily increase since 19 March, and the number of people requiring hospital treatment also fell. In Spain, the growth rate of the number of infections was the lowest since the pandemic began.
The uplifting data appears to confirm the positive impact of effective physical distancing on the virus’s spread. Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, is expected to extend the country’s lockdown well beyond its current end date of 13 April, and the government will wait to see the downward trends maintained over a number of days. In Spain, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has already extended the shutdown until 26 April. But the welcome flattening of those dismal curves creates dilemmas and quandaries that are no less daunting for being the result of good news.
As Spanish and Italian citizens desperately seek some respite and the spectre of the deepest global recession since the 1930s looms, their politicians’ thoughts are turning to how to manage a loosening of restrictions on people and business, while minimisingthe risk of triggering a second deadly wave.
The task, as Mr Speranza says, is to work out a way “to live with the virus” until a vaccine is discovered. Mr Sánchez has indicated that a ban on all non-essential work will be lifted after Easter. Other European countries, including France and Austria, where some shops will reopen next week, have also begun to game-plan the second phase of the crisis. The modus vivendi will, if it is to work, involve continued physical distancing, much greater testing and contact tracing in the community, and a functioning antibody test to establish who has had and recovered from the disease. The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, has emphasised that any easing of the lockdown in France will be “fearsomely complex” and is not likely to happen “in one move everywhere and for everyone”. The politics of easing lockdown will be as fraught and treacherous as imposing it in the first place.
As the death rate here continues to rise steeply, ministers are, rightly, preoccupied with reinforcing one stark message: a rigorously observed lockdown for an extended period to come is the only way to save thousands of lives that would otherwise be lost. But as other countries begin to unveil looser measures, the pressure on the government to reveal its own eventual exit strategy will be intense. It must do the necessary groundwork now.
The challenges will be multiple: in Germany, scientists have estimated that the current level of 50,000 tests a day – compared with around 10,000 in Britain – would be insufficient to allow even a partial end to lockdown. A system of effective contact tracing will need to be devised. Certain sections of the population will need to be told that they must continue to stay at home. Particular types of businesses may need to be prioritised at the expense of others. In March, the British government was badly behind the curve when it came to moving to a form of lockdown. If it is to maintain the confidence and cooperation of the public in staying at home, it will soon need to offer a credible account of what comes next.

Faced with a global coronavirus pandemic that is increasingly centered upon the US, Donald Trump has touted several drugs that he claims can help tackle the outbreak.
In March, the US president used a press conference to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine, a common anti-malaria drug, to treat Covid-19, saying: “I sure as hell think we ought to give it a try.”



Chloroquine: Trump's misleading claims spark hoarding and overdoses







Read more





He followed this with a tweet that claimed the use of the drug in combination with azithromycin, an antibiotic, could be “one of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine”. On Sunday Trump again touted hydroxychloroquine, saying “there are some very strong, powerful signs” of its potential as a Covid-19 therapy.
Trump has been repeatedly contradicted by public health experts including his own top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, who has warned that there is only “anecdotal evidence” that the drugs could be helpful.
Confronted with this disparity Trump, who has repeatedly made false and misleading assertions throughout the coronavirus crisis, responded by telling reporters that “I’m a smart guy” and “I’ve been right a lot”. The Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity have been promoting hydroxychloroquine on their shows.
Last week the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided hydroxychloroquine with an “emergency use authorization” to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. State officials in New York have said that about 4,000 seriously ill patients are now being treated with the drug.
But with some Americans turning to unconventional, and potentially deadly, treatments for coronavirus, medical experts have called for considered, accurate information to avoid exacerbating the pandemic.
Last month an Arizona man died and his wife was left in critical condition after the couple took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is related to the composition of the anti-malaria treatment promoted by Trump.
“Trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,” the woman told NBC, before advising: “Don’t take anything. Don’t believe anything. Don’t believe anything that the president says and his people … call your doctor.”
Here are the key things to know:
What is hydroxychloroquine?
Hydroxychloroquine, also known by its brand name, Plaquenil, is a drug used to treat malaria. It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.
It is also readily available to Americans – already approved as a malaria and anti-inflammation treatment by the FDA – where it is an off-the-shelf drug with various low-cost generic versions. Despite the emergency use order, the FDA has not conducted clinical trials to fully ascertain whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19.
Why is Trump touting it?
Trump was influenced by a widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.
However, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, with Olivier Véran, France’s health minister, saying that it shouldn’t be used by anyone with the exception of “serious forms of hospitalization and on the collegial decision of doctors and under strict medical supervision”.
What does the evidence show?
The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections from Sars-CoV-2, the virus behind Covid-19, by blocking it from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn’t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhea.
Regardless of these findings, any drug being used for a certain purpose before full clinical trials are completed is, by definition, untested and unproven. It’s too early to say if hydroxychloroquine can have a major benefit or not.
The European Medicines Agency, an agency of the EU, has said hydroxychloroquine should not be taken by coronavirus patients except for clinical trials or emergency use programs.
Are there any downsides to this drug being in demand?
Like many drugs, hydroxychloroquine comes with a number of potential side-effects. These include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, weight loss and mood changes.
Worse, a sudden surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. Hydroxychloroquine is able to keep lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease, in check but some people with the condition have complained they are now unable to find Plaquenil. Trump’s pushing of the treatment has caused many Americans, whether they need it or not, to stock up on the drug.
What should people do instead?
The latest Chinese research suggests that using hydroxychloroquine is no better than more conventional coronavirus treatments, such as bed rest, antiviral drugs and oxygen inhalation. There are about 40 different research efforts around the world to find a vaccine, which may take a year or more, while scientists rummaging around in the existing medical cabinet have identified some other drugs that may be repurposed to tackle Covid-19. But this work, too, will take time.
Conclusion?
There is no magic cure for this pandemic, no matter what Trump says.

Move over Mozart, here comes Stelios Kerasidis. A seven-year-old Greek prodigy has penned an “isolation waltz” inspired by the pandemic. 
The hypnotic, fugue-like melody has picked up more than 43,000 hits on YouTube since its launch last week.
“Hi guys! I’m Stelios. Let’s be just a teeny bit more patient and we will soon be out swimming in the sea,” he beams, perched on his piano stool, feet barely touching the floor. “I’m dedicating to you a piece of my own.”
The work, his third composition, was written especially “for people who suffer and those who isolate because of Covid-19,” he adds.

Stelios Kerasidis’s Isolation Waltz
Born in Athens in 2012 to Fotis and Agathe Kerasidis, both pianists who now teach him, Stelios first performed in public at the age of three. 
In 2018 he played Chopin’s Waltz in A Minor at New York’s Carnegie Hall, and last year he appeared at London’s Royal Albert Hall performing on Elton John’s famous red piano.
Stelios says his favourite pianist is the late Canadian Glenn Gould, best known for his technically demanding renditions of Bach variations.
The Greek has shown a flare for composing. His two earlier works were written for his sisters, Veronica and Anastasia, and like Isolation Waltz were met with critical acclaim.
Greece has been under lockdown for longer than most other European nations, the government having closed schools almost a month ago. Last week the government announced that swimming was also forbidden as the measures were ramped up.
The precautionary steps appear to be working: Greece has reported 79 deaths and fewer than 1,800 confirmed coronavirus cases, far fewer than some other countries. 
Stelios, who is likely to be homebound for some time yet, has not hinted whether he has another composition up his sleeve.

Tributes have been paid to nine bus workers who have lost theirs lives to the coronavirus, with colleagues calling for more robust measures to protect others working in the transport system.
Two of those drivers, plus a garage supervisor, worked for bus company Metroline. Alperton bus garage driver Said Musse and Holloway driver Emeka Nyack Ihenacho lost their lives along with Paul Aheto, who worked as a supervisor at the Willesden garage.
A Metroline spokesman said: “It is with immense sadness that we can confirm that three of our colleagues have passed away after contracting coronavirus.
“We are devastated by this loss and we offer our support and condolences to the families at this incredibly difficult time.
“The safety of our employees has always been our priority and we continue to do everything we can to make sure our workforce is as protected and as safe as possible during this unprecedented time.”

Nadir Nur was one of the eight bus drivers in London to die in the last few days. The 48-year-old was described as a quiet but well liked individual at his depot. He worked for HCT Group and drove the 394 bus between Islington and Hackney, and was described to be in good health before being infected.
Tributes were also paid to Rodolfo Silva who had worked for bus company Go-Ahead London. A spokesman for the company said: “We were informed on Friday morning that Mr Silva had sadly died. The cause of his death has yet to be established.
“Our thoughts are with Mr Silva’s family and friends at this very difficult time. Mr Silva was a dedicated and popular member of our Waterside Way team.”
The ninth bus worker was Martin Egan, who had worked as a driver in Bristol for 40 years. He died on Saturday after falling ill two weeks ago.
The Unite union’s regional secretary for the south-west Steve Preddy paid tribute to Egan, describing him as a “dedicated and long-serving member of the Unite Bristol bus family”.
As the news of the deaths sunk in on Monday, some drivers remained seriously concerned about their own wellbeing. One bus driver on a west London route has taken to bringing clingfilm from his own kitchen to cover perforations in Perspex screens shielding him from coronavirus infection inside his cabin.

In a letter to the Guardian on Monday, the partner of the bus worker also revealed that he takes a urine bottle with him on his journeys because unofficial toilet stops for drivers are now closed.
Eileen Hill (not her real name) said her partner, who also wishes to remain anonymous but whose status has been verified by the Guardian, even brings his own sanitiser and mask to protect himself from contracting Covid-19.
“He takes safety into his own hands,” she said. “He brings his own clingfilm, mask, hand sanitiser and a huge spray bottle of Dettol. He disinfects the cab before he gets in, sprays his mask, arranges his clingfilm and opens the window as wide as it will go. With mixed reports around whether this disease is airborne, he just hopes these measures are enough,” his wife said.

She continued: “The working conditions have worsened since the new rules (on self-isolation and lockdown). Now everywhere is shut, the toilets have gone too, and he has to carry his own urine bottle – a situation that’s far worse for female drivers.”
Hill’s partner had an informal arrangement like other drivers with a local swimming pool, a snooker hall and a café on his route to go to the toilet during the journey, she said.
The bus driver’s partner said he has told her that while most people are obeying the lockdown and social-distancing rules some are not.
In her letter Hill relates an incident at the weekend on his bus: “‘You’re late,’ spits a stocky man in baseball cap, as he taps his Oyster card, tiny flecks of phlegm hitting the clingfilm my husband has used to cover the holes in the Perspex around the cab. He taps the pre-recorded message. ‘It’s all a hoax,’ yells the man leaning closer.
“That is why my partner takes safety into his own hands. “
The TfL spokesperson stressed that it was in discussion with unions over the issues they have raised about safety and protective measures.
“We all want to ensure the greatest level of safety for everyone in the bus industry and for the critical workers who need to make absolutely essential bus journeys,” she said.
Unite’s representative for London bus workers John Murphy said it was “hardly surprising” that one of his colleagues was deploying his own means of protection against the virus on his vehicle.
Murphy said the union has been informed by TFL that by the middle of this week Perspex screens with full cover will be in place on all buses in use across the capital.
“I am not in the least surprised that the driver has taken these steps by himself. These protective measures should be made available to him but in their absence it is understandable and I am sure others are doing this too,” he said.

The first two coronavirus deaths among care workers in England were announced on Monday, as industry leaders hit out at chronic shortages of protective equipment and urged the government to start treating social care as “a second front line”.
Carol Jamabo, 56, a community carer for Cherish Elderly Care in Bury in Greater Manchester, died last Wednesday.
Another carer died in a home run by MHA, the UK’s largest charitable social care provider, which said it was unclear where she contracted the virus. The death of a West Dumbartonshire care worker which emerged on Sunday was also confirmed by the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon.
The fatalities came amid rising concern that those working in social care still do not have the protection they need amid the Covid-19 pandemic and that, without testing for the virus, staff risk contaminating care homes where elderly people are supposed to be “shielded”.
Peter Kyle, the MP for Hove – which has about 30 care homes - said facilities are effectively being “converted into hospices” because of a lack of protections. He said one home in his constituency had recorded 14 cases of coronavirus in residents aged over 75.

In Scotland, at least 15 residents at the 90-capacity Burlington Court care home in Glasgow have died after displaying symptoms of the virus.
They all had underlying health conditions and several were on “end of life pathways”, according to the care provider, Four Seasons. It declined to provide an update on further deaths, amid unconfirmed reports that several more residents were infected.
Nadra Ahmed, executive chair of the National Care Association, which represents small and medium-sized care providers, said: “The issue we hear most is: ‘I am desperate for masks. Has anyone got any gloves? I am down to my last stock.’
“Once you run out, it is a question of being down to Marigolds and bin liners. Government has not reacted quickly enough to build confidence in the sector that PPE [personal protective equipment] is available.”
Kent county council is so short of protection items that it has asked partner organisations and thousands of its staff to try to drum up supplies. It said on Monday it has made “strong representations” to the government about shortages and has been promised deliveries, but believes these will not meet its needs.
On 25 March, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was asked in parliament when all care home workers would get the protective equipment they needed and replied: “By the end of the week.”
Many in the care sector say this has not happened.
Liz Kendall, Labour MP for Leicester West, said about one in three care homes in her constituency still had no PPE on Friday.
“While [chancellor] Rishi Sunak was right to say the NHS would get whatever resources it needs, the same has got to be true for social care because the two services are inextricably linked,” she said.
Care workers can use large quantities of PPE if they follow government guidance that – in care homes with suspected or confirmed Covid cases or on domestic visits to a shielded person - they should wear gloves, plastic apron, mask and possibly eye and face protection.
Some care managers are going into debt to keep staff and residents safe. Anita Astle, manager of the Wren Hall nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where nine residents are in isolation with suspected Covid-19, paid £9,000 for a consignment of masks at £2.74 each – five times the usual price – because government supplies were insufficient.
“The first delivery [from the government supply] was 160 masks,” she said. “I told them we were using 312 a day. I waited four days and got 400. The supply chain is completely useless.”
Sam Monaghan, chief executive of MHA, said: “People who work in the care sector are extraordinary individuals, each and every one of them, and I can’t impress enough how important it is that we get testing and adequate levels of PPE to keep them and residents safe.”
The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.

Nicola Sturgeon has disclosed she asked Scotland’s chief medical officer to resign on Sunday night after realising her breaches of lockdown regulations were damaging public confidence.
The first minister told reporters on Monday she reversed her earlier decision to publicly defend Catherine Calderwood after it became clear later on Sunday that the CMO’s position was untenable.
It is understood Calderwood, an obstetrician, could face an investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC), the medical profession’s regulator of which she is a member, for potentially breaching its codes of conduct.
Part 75 of the GMC’s good practice code requires doctors to immediately report any incident where they are cautioned or charged by the police. There is no equivalent of a caution under Scottish law, but the chief constable of Police Scotland, Iain Livingstone, disclosed on Sunday that his officers had visited her at home and issued her with a warning about breaching the lockdown. The Times reported that her husband, Angus Loudon, was also given a warning.
Part 65 of the code says doctors must “act with honesty and integrity”, and “must make sure your conduct justifies your patients’ trust in your and the public’s trust in the profession”.

Calderwood apologised on Sunday after admitting that the couple had twice visited their holiday home in Earlsferry, Fife, during the lockdown and had taken their family and go for an overnight stay last Friday night, visiting the local beach.
Calderwood has been approached for comment. The GMC would not confirm whether any complaints had been made about her conduct.
Sturgeon denied news management was a factor in the timing of the resignation announcement, which came on Sunday night just as it emerged that Boris Johnson had been hospitalised with Covid-19. She said she and Calderwood agreed the CMO should quit after a long conversation to discuss their options.
“What was at the forefront of my mind was how firstly I continue to make sure I have the best advice to enable me to deal with this virus, but also how I ensured that the confidence of the public in the advice we are giving then was maintained,” Sturgeon said.
“Those were things I was weighing up during the day and as you know, I came to a view last night that the CMO had to resign in order to make sure we maintained that confidence.”
Calderwood’s resignation capped a difficult day for Sturgeon and the Scottish government, after the Scottish Sun published photographs of the CMO and her family breaching the lockdown she had been instructing the public to follow in the government’s information films.
The first minister had insisted during her daily coronavirus briefing at 2pm on Sunday that Calderwood could not and should not quit because her expertise was essential to her; Sturgeon hinted the CMO had offered to resign, but she had rejected it.
At 4.40pm Sturgeon announced via press release Calderwood would stand back from all public-facing work on the epidemic. At 9.54pm, the Scottish government announced she had quit.
Sturgeon said on Monday she had seen emails and tweets from the public on Sunday evening that made clear allowing Calderwood to remain in office put the lockdown policy at risk. “That’s not a risk that I, and to be fair to her, she was prepared to take,” the first minister said.
Sturgeon said Calderwood had not told the Scottish government she and her husband had made two visits to Earlsferry during the lockdown on Saturday, when the government was first asked for comment by the Scottish Sun.
That government statement claimed she had visited to “check on” the property. “The statement which went out was a reflection of our understanding at that time of the reasons for her visit that weekend,” Sturgeon said. “She later made clear that there had been a second visit and of course made that clear at the briefing yesterday, so that’s the situation there.”

The US Centers for Disease Control now recommends that all Americans wear face masks in public to reduce transmission of Covid-19. Because there are widespread shortages of medical-grade face masks, and leaders and experts agree those should be reserved for healthcare providers, individuals are largely making face masks at home.
Jeremy Howard, a University of San Francisco researcher and the co-founder of Masks 4 All, explains how to create your own, with no sewing required.

Version one – the T-shirt facemask:

 Photograph: Masks 4 All
Start with an old T-shirt, preferably 100% cotton – anything will do, as long as it’s not too thin – and outline the pattern of the mask. The bottom line should go just beneath the armpits of the shirt. Make sure the part that goes on your face is large enough to cover your nose and mouth.
Cut along the lines through both sides of the shirt so that your mask has two layers.
Place a safety pin along the bottom and insert a piece of paper towel or coffee filter in between the two layers of the T-shirt. This acts as an additional filter, and rests on top of the safety pin.
Secure the mask around the front of your face, covering your nose and mouth. Tie the top straps under the back of your head and the bottom straps at the top of your head. That will ensure a nice fit underneath your chin. By covering your mouth, you have now protected those around you, and the better the fit, the more you’re going to also protect yourself.
Version two – the handkerchief face mask:
Mask instructions CDC -- mobile and desktop
Start with a handkerchief and two hair ties. Rubber bands are okay as well, although they will be less comfortable.
Follow the handkerchief in half, along a horizontal axis, and make a nice crease.
Place piece of paper towel or coffee filter at the center of the handkerchief. Fold the top down and the bottom up, so that the coffee filter or paper towel rests in the fold.
Place your first elastic about one-third of the way in from the edge of the handkerchief. Place the second elastic one-third of the way in from the other side. The two elastics should be about one hand-width apart.
Fold the left side in toward the center and then fold the right side in toward the center, tucking the right side into the left-side flap.
Using and taking care of your mask:
Don’t wear it at home, and don’t wear it in the car, unless you’re with people outside your regular family group. Don’t wear it more than necessary – just wear it when you’re in a public place, like a supermarket, where you might be within 6ft of people. It may not be necessary in a park or on a quiet street with few pedestrians, when you’re moving around.
Don’t remove the mask until you’re at home or in a place where you can wash your hands and avoid coming within 6ft of other people. When you do remove the mask, avoid touching the front of it in case you breathed in infected droplets that could now be there.
Remove and dispose of the paper towel insert. Place the rest of the mask in soapy water, soak it for two minutes, then wash and rinse. Any kind of soap – dish soap, laundry detergent, hand soap – will do. Then wash your hands, and disinfect with bleach or alcohol anything you touched after taking off the mask. Never reuse a mask without washing it first.
Next time you wear the mask, remember to replace the paper-towel insert.
If you have symptoms – a stuffy nose, a cough, a fever – stay inside.

Investors were cheered on Monday by signs that the severity of the coronavirus crisis may be easing, helping the FTSE 100 to shrug off dire UK economic data.
The index of blue-chip shares climbed more than 3% to 5,582, raising hopes of a more sustained recovery after five consecutive weekly falls, with positive sentiment in the UK mirrored on Wall Street and other European indices such as Germany’s Dax.
The market gains followed reports that some European governments were weighing up whether to lift the most stringent lockdown restrictions.
Analysts at the online trading firm IG said this had led to a buying spree, despite the likelihood that the second quarter of the year would be characterised by plunging economic indicators.
“This might seem odd when we can expect weeks of poor data, but the simple fact is that talk of reopening economies is now widespread, and the data from Italy, Spain, Belgium and even New York is providing hope that some countries have passed the peak and others are nearing it,” said Chris Beauchamp, IG’s chief market analyst.
While the FTSE gained 3%, the Dow Jones was up more than 1,000 points or nearly 6% by lunchtime on Wall Street. Germany’s Dax closed up nearly 6%.
However, New York-based foreign exchange company OANDA warned that optimism among stock investors could fizzle out, once attention returns to the likelihood of lasting consumer caution.
“The rally in equities will likely be short-lived as investors will soon have to become sceptical of the great recovery and focus on the financial stress that will happen after several key parts of the economy will not come back to life for many months,” said senior market analyst Edward Moya.
“Travel, entertainment, and physical retail (excluding food and drug) will not see any normalcy until much later in the year. I don’t see people going to a Broadway show, baseball game or trying to book a vacation this summer.”
In the UK, the FTSE’s gain was all the more remarkable given dismal figuresfrom the construction and automotive sectors, which have been ravaged by shutdowns caused by Covid-19.
Construction suffered the sharpest fall in activity since the financial crisis during March, a survey showed on Monday, despite the industry being slower than other industries to shut down operations due to the coronavirus.
The figures from financial data provider IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) also confirmed data last week that showed the British private sector as a whole is contracting at its fastest rate in more than 20 years.
The construction Purchasing Managers’ Index tumbled to 39.3 in March from 52.6 in February, with anything below 50 representing a decline in activity. The drop took the index to its lowest level since April 2009 and well below economists’ average forecast of 44.0.
The 13-point monthly fall was the largest since the survey began in 1997, and the index could worsen still.
“The sector is stuck in quicksand and sinking further,” Duncan Brock, group director at Cips, said.
Some construction projects have continued, with workers spaced two metres apart, allowing construction to escape the complete shutdowns seen elsewhere, such as in the hospitality industry.
Gareth Belsham, director of property consultancy Naismiths, said the continuation of some activity, coupled with the sector’s experience of recovering from economic turmoil, should give cause for optimism.
“Few sectors have more bitter, regular experience of enduring sharp falls in confidence than construction.
“Battle scars in of themselves will provide no protection from a simultaneous drop in both demand and supply. But the fact that the declines seen during the 2008 financial crisis were worse offers some comfort. Construction weathered that storm successfully, and will do so again.”

The automotive sector has been particularly hard hit over the past three weeks. Every major car manufacturer in the UK has shut down its factories and the industry trade body revealed on Monday that demand for new vehicles has also plunged, spelling more trouble ahead for the sector.
Sales of new cars in March fell 44% compared with the same month last year to 254,684 units, while first-quarter sales were down by 31% to 483,557, the SMMT said.
The trade body also slashed its sales forecast for this year by 23% to 1.73m vehicles because of the impact of the coronavirus crisis.

In difficult times, people are turning to all sorts of creative methods to bring joy (and a little bit of friendly fear) to those around them.
Exterminate/self-isolate
The public have been warned tougher measures will have to be implemented if people do not adhere to physical distancing rules, but no one expected it to come in the form of extraterrestrial villains.
Residents of Robin Hood’s Bay, near Whitby, were surprised to see a Dalek patrolling the streets telling people to stay indoors.
“By order of the Daleks, all humans must stay indoors, all humans must self-isolate,” the Doctor Who villain screeched as it zoomed along the street.

It is unclear who is behind the creative stunt, which some found amusing, but it brought back scary memories for many fans of the long-running sci-fi series.
One Twitter user wrote: “Am I the only one to feel a genuine shiver of fear watching this? As a child I would most certainly have been hiding behind the sofa. And if a Cyberman came marching down the road, that would be it, I’d be running for my life!”
Tayside police in Scotland shared the video, saying: “Our colleagues in Skaro division have deployed their Direct Action Local Enforcement Kops to ensure everyone is following guidelines about isolation and social distancing.”
Girl thanks hundreds of key workers with personalised display
An eight-year-old girl from Chesterfield has thanked NHS staff and key workers with an elaborate window display featuring hundreds of their names.
Grace Cooper came up with the idea as a way of keeping busy during the lockdown, and, after her mum issued a callout for names on Facebook, they were soon inundated.
She has carefully written each name on a love heart, around a sign that reads: “Not all heroes wear capes.”
Grace said: “It’s to thank all the key workers for going out and risking their lives to save us. I want them all to know they are appreciated and we are grateful to them.”
Her mother, Lauren Liggatt, told the Derbyshire Times: “We’ve got hundreds of names now and I’ve got a huge pile which I need to put up. We’ve filled one window are now moving on to another one.
“Grace is really pleased with it and I am so proud of her. She said she wanted to thank the people who are working to keep us safe and well, and that is so nice of her.”
Police make special visit to birthday boy in lockdown

Dexter Lee should have been celebrating his birthday on holiday with his family but the trip had to be cancelled when the lockdown came into force.
Unable to see any of his friends or family on the special day, Dexter’s mum, Anna, asked if anyone knew of a police officer who could cheer up her son, who wants to join the force when he is older, with a special wave as they drove past.

What do the restrictions involve?

People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:
Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible
One form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household
Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person
Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home
Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:
Close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship
Stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with
Stop all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals
Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.

To her surprise, Sgt Mark Wilson from Merseyside police, along with the force mascot, Bobby, turned up with a goody bag and a superhero card from Ch Con Andy Cooke especially for Dexter.
Dexter and his big brother, Freddie, even got to sit in the police van, while their grandparents watched from their cars, which were parked nearby.
“The most we were hoping for was for a police officer to drive by and flash the sirens. We are so overwhelmed by the effort the police went to today. It has brought a lot of cheer to us and the whole neighbourhood,” Dexter’s parents said.
Couple stuck in neverending Maldives honeymoon
Hundreds of travellers are still stranded around the world after coronavirus lockdowns came into force – but one honeymooning couple ended up better off than most.
Surrounded by a fleet of staff catering to their every need on a luxury Maldivian resort, Olivia and Raul De Freitas have found themselves on an eternal honeymoon.
Arriving at the Cinnamon Velifushi Maldives resort on 22 March for what was supposed to be a six-night stay, the newlyweds were soon the only two guests left when their home country, South Africa, closed its airports in response to the pandemic and they were unable to leave.
The resort, which hosts up to 180 guests, continued to put on a full performance in the dining hall each night for the pair while nine staff members remained on standby.
Room service checked on them five times a day, while other workers treated the couple to an elaborate candlelit dinner on the beach, they told the New York Times.

They were told they would have to hire a chartered jet with other South Africans stuck in the Maldives in order to get home. But, at a cost of a $104,000, they decided to stay put.
They have now been transferred to another luxury resort, along with other South Africans in the region, with a large proportion of their costs subsidised. However, their return date remains unknown.

Concerns are being raised that people isolating at home with worsening Covid-19 symptoms may not call for medical help early enough when they enter the second, more severe, phase of the virus, possibly reducing their chances of survival.
The NHS does not have a proper monitoring system for those suspected of having coronavirus, said Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school.
“If a patient is developing pneumonia, it can get progressively worse very quickly and hence early admission upon the first signs of difficulty with breathing are very important,” he said.
“It is important for people recovering at home that there be a monitoring system in place too. Something that we have thus far not introduced.”
Quick guide What to do if you have coronavirus symptoms in the UK  
 Show 
 Hide  

Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:
a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly
NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days.
If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start. Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.
If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.
If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.
After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.
If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.
If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.
Staying at home means you should:
not go to work, school or public areas
not use public transport or taxis
not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home
not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home
You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.
If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the NHS 111 coronavirus service to find out what to do.

There is a danger that people will arrive in hospital only when their symptoms are very severe, with more of a risk that they will end up in critical care and possibly die, he said.
The early symptoms of mild disease are a persistent dry cough, a raised temperature and shortness of breath. The advice to anyone with those symptoms is to self-isolate at home. They are not told to inform the health service.
Most people recover within a week, but if their symptoms worsen or they still have a high temperature at the end of that time, the instruction is to fill in a form on the NHS 111 coronavirus website if they can – and to call NHS 111 only if they cannot do that. Depending on their answers, they may get a visit from a doctor or be admitted to hospital.
Covid-19 is said to be mild to moderate in 80% of people, but can cause viral pneumonia. In the most serious cases, the immune system fighting the virus overreacts. If that happens, what is known as a cytokine storm attacks their organs. The individual will need ventilation in hospital to take over their breathing and possibly mechanical support for their heart, liver or kidneys.
People with symptoms at home will not get medical help unless they ask for it, unlike in some other countries, which have testing for people with symptoms and monitoring for them while at home.

Health authorities in the southern German city of Heidelberg have introduced a “corona taxi” service, which allows medical personnel to visit patients with the virus at home and assess their progress. This was introduced after virologists and other doctors recognised that it often comes in two waves and that typically on the eighth day, patients’ health can take a turn for the worse.
Patients with confirmed infections or suspected to have coronavirus are being called on a regular basis by student doctors manning phone lines, and based on their accounts, a taxi crew can then arrange to visit them.
Four of the taxis – small buses usually used for school runs – are constantly travelling around the city visiting patients. 
“These daily phone calls and house visits would totally overwhelm the doctors here,” said Uta Merle, a medical director for gastroenterology and infections at Heidelberg University hospital, which is why medical students are being drafted in. Eight hundred have so far volunteered.
Hans-Georg Kräusslich, the head of virology at the hospital, told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung the visits are necessary because “often patients don’t have the courage to ring up the clinic and don’t actually take their worsening state seriously”.
Thanks to the taxis, he said, “our colleagues have discovered quite a few patients who they were able to protect from a drastic worsening of their conditions”. 
Many have been brought into hospital and put on ventilators as a result. That crucial move made just in time is believed to have saved many lives in Germany. The taxi crews have received letters of thanks from patients, crediting them with saving their lives.
Pankhania said people in the UK are no longer going to hospital for conditions other than Covid-19 in the sort of numbers that would be expected. “For whatever reason, we have frightened off the patient. Those things we should be seeing are not turning up. These people are soldiering on,” he said.

He has himself heard of cases where people were very sick with symptoms resembling those of Covid-19, but did not seek medical help and died at home.
He said it was possible that some people were put off from calling NHS 111 when their symptoms worsened or if they still had a fever after a week – which are the first clues that their condition may be becoming severe.
He also does not think it is satisfactory for people with symptoms not to be tested. “I don’t think that is good enough,” he said. “I used to be a GP. I would want to know who my patients with Covid-19 were. I would call them and ask them how they were. Unfortunately, that doesn’t happen. The GP may or may not be aware of the patient.”
The Office for National Statistics has recently begun to include deaths from Covid-19 in the community, including care homes. They show the total was more than 20% higher than the figure for hospital deaths alone.

Iran’s health ministry spokesman has backtracked after he described China’s official figures on the coronavirus outbreak as a “joke”.
Kianoush Jahanpour made the remarks at a press conference and a tweet on Sunday, adding that China had given the impression that coronavirus was like influenza but with fewer deaths.
Quick guide What to do if you have coronavirus symptoms in the UK  
 Show 
 Hide  

Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:
a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly
NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days.
If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.
After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start. Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.
If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.
If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.
After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.
If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.
If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.
Staying at home means you should:
not go to work, school or public areas
not use public transport or taxis
not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home
not go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home
You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.
If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the NHS 111 coronavirus service to find out what to do.

His tweet led led to a reproach from the Chinese ambassador to Iran, Chang Hua, who said China’s health ministry had held a press conference every day. “I suggest that you read their news very carefully in order to draw conclusions,” the ambassador said.
Chinese-Iranian relations are normally warm, partly because China is a key market for Iranian oil, and criticism of China’s coronavirus figures had previously come exclusively from the west.
Jahanpour said he had merely been commenting on how China’s epidemiological assessment of coronavirus was not shared by Iran.
After Chinese representations to the Iranian foreign ministry, Jahanpour, a familiar face on Iranian TV, said on Monday: “We should also see the glass half full. At the very least, we all decided that we had to respect principles of diplomacy.”

Meanwhile, Iran announced plans to ban printed newspapers in an effort to slow the spread of the disease. Editors of seven titles including the reformist Etemad and Ebtekar protested against the decision, saying it represented a further incursion of press freedom and would bankrupt them.
Alireza Zali, the commander-in-chief of the anti-coronavirus HQ in Tehran, said: “Especially in Tehran province, we have witnessed a very serious change in the presence and movement of people in cities, and unfortunately, at a time when we are witnessing this increase in motor traffic, the numbers entering Tehran’s hospitals is still increasing.”
He said there had been a 25% increase in hospital admissions and a 15% increase in intensive care admissions on Sunday compared with the previous day.
Iran said on Monday that its death toll from coronavirus had risen to 3,739, an increase of 136 in the past 24 hours, and a total of 60,500 people had been infected, up 2,274 since the previous day.

Scott Morrison’s approval has been boosted sharply by his management of the Covid-19 response with a substantial number of Labor and Green voters joining the applause.
The prime minister’s national approval jumped from 41% in March to 59% this month, according to Essential Research polling released Tuesday.
His disapproval rating shrank from 49% to 31% over the same period.
But the prime minister’s performance has not eased our concerns about the coronavirus threat. They have intensified since early March when 63% of voters were very concerned or quite concerned.

Essential Research found that on 29 March the figure had risen to 88% of voters who were very concerned or quite concerned. And this week the proportion had not changed.
Not surprisingly the most fearful age group were voters aged 55 and over, some 90% of whom were very or quite concerned.
But younger voters were also apprehensive. Some 85% of voters aged 18 to 34 years were very or quite concerned.
However, the federal government will take heart from the broad support, and the Essential poll revealed a significant number of Morrison’s traditional political enemies were among those saluting him.
It found 45% of Labor voters approved or strongly approved of his performance. And the same proportion of Labor voters disapproved or strongly disapproved of the job he was doing. That produced a net approval rating of 46% of Labor loyalists.
And a remarkable 29% of Green voters backed or strongly backed the prime minister. However, a majority of Green voters – 55% – were not impressed, producing a net disapproval rating of 56%.
The Labor and Green support could reflect the interventionist measures the federal government has launched, particularly on wage replacement and increased dole payments.
They are policies which contrast with the conservative economic and welfare stances Morrison championed pre-pandemic.
But those policies have not put off coalition voters, 87% of whom told Essential Research they approved or strongly approved of Morrison’s actions.
The approval rating of Labor leader Anthony Albanese rose from 41% in March to 44% in April and his disapproval fell from 33% to 29%.

A number of Aboriginal health groups in Victoria have been forced to cease Covid-19 testing and consider shutting their doors due to a lack of personal protective equipment.
The Guardian revealed last week that Aboriginal medical services in New South Wales, particularly in regional areas, were struggling to access the PPE needed to safely treat and test for the virus.
Some clinics had just two weeks of PPE left with no immediate prospect of re-supply, creating a situation they described as “catastrophic”.

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s daily coronavirus email newsletter
The Guardian understands the NSW government has now written to the commonwealth asking for the urgent release of supplies to the state’s Aboriginal medical services and for direct access to the government’s national medical stockpile.
The problem, though, is not confined to NSW.
In Victoria, Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations have warned they are facing “critical” PPE shortages, which have forced some into the difficult position of stopping Covid-19 testing until new stock is provided.
A number of Aboriginal health groups are making their own PPE to get by, according to the the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation Inc (VACCHO), the peak body for Indigenous health and wellbeing in the state.
Others have considered closing entirely because they cannot source enough equipment.
VACCHO chair Karen Heap said the centre she runs in Ballarat – the Ballarat & District Aboriginal Co-Operative – had run out of PPE and been forced to close temporarily last week.
The centre was conducting Covid-19 testing for Indigenous Australians and has since re-opened. But Heap says it only has one to two weeks of PPE left.
“We’ve struggled for quite a while,” Heap told the Guardian. “We’ve run out. We found a few gowns that we could use, but we haven’t got a good supply at all.”

“We know we’re not the only ones asking for PPE, it’s across the nation. But we’re trying to provide a service to the Aboriginal community across Victoria and we’d like to be able to help with testing.
“It just makes it easier for our community to come to our health services to get tested … they know us.”
Aboriginal health services in both NSW and Victoria have been shifting to telehealth wherever possible to reduce demand on PPE and employing social distancing measures to protect staff and patients.
“We’re actually in Ballarat just starting to make our own gowns as well, just in readiness, just in case we need them,” Heap said. “We’re hoping we don’t need them, but if we do, we’ve got some people in our community who can sew, so we’ve put them to task,”
But Heap said if more equipment was not received soon, the consequences would be serious.
“We just won’t be able to test at all and we’ll have to be very careful about who we see through the clinic, especially people with the symptoms of the virus,” she said.
The release of PPE from the federal government’s national medical stockpile – a reserve of medical equipment held in secret locations across the country – is being prioritised to those who need it most.
The government has identified Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as a high-risk group during the Covid-19 pandemic, because of overall higher rates of respiratory disease, heart disease, and diabetes, as well as overcrowded housing.
A taskforce of experts in Indigenous health and epidemiology advising the national cabinet has released a detailed plan for dealing with the virus, which recommends urgent supplies of PPE and other medical equipment to regional and remote areas.
But, in a further sign of the severity of PPE shortages among Aboriginal medical services, NSW health minister Brad Hazzard and Aboriginal affairs minister Don Harwin wrote to federal health minister Greg Hunt asking for help last week.
It is understood the pair asked the federal government to urgently increase the supply of PPE to Aboriginal community-controlled health services in NSW.
They also asked that changes be made to allow Aboriginal medical services direct access to the national medical stockpile – an emergency reserve of medical equipment – rather than having to make their requests through the primary health network.
Such allowances have already been made for the aged care sector.
A NSW Health spokeswoman said the state and federal governments were working together to “urgently increase the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services”.
The state government has also provided a “one-off supply” of PPE to the sector in the week beginning 23 March, the spokeswoman said.

Hunt on Sunday announced that about 11m masks had recently been distributed to frontline workers, and that the national medical stockpile had been replenished by the receipt of 30m masks in recent weeks.
A spokeswoman said 1.6m surgical and P2 masks had been distributed to the NSW government in recent days.
“Significant additional supplies of masks have now arrived in Australia and the government is working with states and territories to allocate an initial additional 10 million masks to support front line healthcare professionals,” she said.
“There are global shortages of masks and other PPE and the government is securing supplies to meet the demand of states and territories.”
Hunt expects to make up to 200m masks available by the end of the year and finance minister, Mathias Cormann, announced an additional $800m for PPE supply on the weekend.
The government has attempted to help local manufacturers to pivot into PPE production and help existing producer Med-Con to boost its output.
The Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW last week warned that clinics require urgent action to boost PPE stocks.

In the first wave of coronavirus panic buying in Australia, shoppers hoarded toilet paper. Then they came for pasta, rice and tinned food. A week or so later, there was a shortage of napkins, paper towels and tissues.
On 22 March there was a run on bottle shops, as shoppers, thinking outlets might close under new laws, stockpiled alcohol. In the confusion as to whether bottle shops were an essential service, trolleys were stacked with spirits, wine and cases of beer.“Can report there is now panic buying at Dan Murphy’s. Every car space in our local branch is full, everyone is loading up. We’re going to be one trashed socially isolated nation for a while,” one person wrote on Twitter.

Can report there is now panic buying at Dan Murphy's. Every car space in our local branch is full, every one is loading up. We're going to be one trashed socially isolated nation for a while.

March 22, 2020

Commsec reported spending was up more than 20% in the week ending 20 March, compared with the same time last year; and in the week to March 27, spending at liquor stores in Australia was up 86%. Although that rise was off-set by the closure of bars, restaurants and pubs, that week Australians still spent 34% more on alcohol than at the same period the previous year.Now we’re all sitting at home drinking our stockpiled alcohol and having parties on apps, but experts are warning that as well as the pandemic, we’re facing another public health crisis – heavy drinking.
Peter, a 59-year-old marketing manager from Sydney’s upper north shore, was one of those stockpiling alcohol on the weekend of 22 March.
His wife brought three cases of champagne, while he bought “two lots of wine – three crates [12 bottles] both times – and it’s time to refresh those”.
“Since I’ve been working from home, I’ve been slipping into bad ways. I’m not concerned about it yet – but it’s not a good habit,” says Peter, who has been in lockdown for two weeks.

Before quarantine, he only drank on weekends, but now he says, “We’re both [Peter and his wife] working from home and we’ve been drinking every day starting at 5.30pm. Right now, there’s no consequences – no one notices if you get a bit wooly the next day, and other people are in the same boat. There’s a lot of drinking memes going round. I am not at all surprised that … sales are going through the roof,” he says.
Professor Michael Farrell, director of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales Sydney, says the scenes broadcast from crowded bottle shops in late March showed “there’s been an assault on bottle shops – and it’s very clear that sales have gone up. The vulnerability is for people who are already on the margins of heavy drinking. They have had their constraints removed from them.”
These constraints, removed by staying at home, include being able to drink during the day, or being hungover without being detected by employers.



It creates a situation where people are habituated to drinking daily
Chris Raine, Hello Sunday Morning

But he says people are also drinking because of “the anxiety about the complex social situation we are in. People are worried about their jobs, finances and getting ill. They are stockpiling alcohol – it’s a social storm”. 
Chris Raine, founder of Hello Sunday Morning, a movement that aims to help people reduce or quit drinking via an accountability app and online counselling, has noticed an “uptick” in the service since people started self-isolating. “Registrations have doubled,” he says.

“It’s really quite scary to be honest – it’s a perfect storm because you have a culture that does rely on alcohol to de-stress and deal with anxiety and now those stresses and anxieties have gone through the roof as a result of the virus.”
Raine worries that under these conditions, “it creates a situation where people are habituated to drinking daily”.
This unusual situation creates the possibility of a cascade effect, says Raine. Weekend drinkers become weekday drinkers; social drinkers become daily drinkers; and those struggling with sobriety, who have relied on the face-to-face assistance of groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (now using Zoom because of physical distancing rules), will relapse.



Coronavirus cancelled my wedding and made me sick. What now?

Farrell agrees, saying people “are left socially isolated – so the normal help is gone”.
He hopes apps such as Daybreak (set up by Raine’s Hello Sunday Morning team) will bridge the gap created by the suspension of face-to-face support groups and counselling.
“One of the things you can do is promote telephone services for counselling people – it’s not very hard to switch into that,” he says. “And you can use apps to get support while isolating. Prevention programs will come later down the line.”
Farrell says right now “the only thing you could do [to halt the problem] potentially is to ration sales”.
Currently the industry’s self-imposed ration limit is fairly generous, says Farrell.
On 1 April, large alcohol retailers in most states (except Western Australia where there are already measures in force) signed up for a voluntary code that limits the amount of liquor customers can buy in one transaction.
Beer, cider and premixed spirits are limited to two cases, and wine to 12 bottles per customer, while cask wine and bottled spirits are limited to two items each.



People should have a number of days where they forgo alcohol
Professor Michael Farrell

Any further restrictions, such as closing bottle shops, might be too much to bear, says Farrell, as “there is enough social control at the moment”.
Instead, “we should focus people on learning physical and mental health hygiene and good regimes around exercise and food. People should have a number of days where they forgo alcohol”.
When Raine saw “the rush on buying alcohol”, he says, “My gut reaction was ‘typical’ and ‘understandable’ but then digging into it, it’s how Australians see alcohol as an essential service – almost culturally seeing alcohol as an essential medicine.”
Raine acknowledges that if the bottle shops were not deemed an essential service and shut down, the results would be disastrous. “You’d have tens of thousands of people going into involuntary detox and not having the health system able to cope. I wish people didn’t culturally depend on alcohol the way they do.”
For people like Peter, entering his third week in social isolation, this is the week to start tracking his drinking.
“There’s moments where it’s appropriate to say ‘bugger it’ and get drunk, but you can’t maintain that throughout the crisis.”
Friday night was going to be Peter’s first Zoom drinks with friends, but the following week he decided to go back to drinking only two nights a week, on weekends.
“It’s very novel territory – it’s hard,” says Raine. “But all difficult things bear the fruit of opportunity. And we can grow and become more resilient.”

The federal government has launched a new attempt to find more domestic manufacturers to supply it with the materials needed for Covid-19 testing, a move crossbench senator Rex Patrick says has started too late.
On Friday, the government issued a callout seeking Australian companies that may be able to manufacture various components used in Covid-19 testing, including the sterile tubes used to store and transport swabs, nucleic acid extraction kits, and essential chemicals.

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s daily coronavirus email newsletter
The process is designed to better gauge Australia’s capability to manufacture such material locally, in the face of extraordinary global demand and pressure on existing supply chains.
Patrick, who himself tested positive to Covid-19 last month, described the delay between the first confirmed Australian case on 25 January and the initiation of the process as a “failure of government”. That failure was both one of the delayed response and the “longer-term strategic issue” of Australia’s sovereign capabilities at times of crisis.
“With all the conversations on testing, why did it take until this month to seek information about Covid-19 test kit materials?” he said.
Australia has conducted 299,000 tests and has one of the highest testing rates per capita in the world. Jurisdictions such as Victoria have recently moved to relax testing criteria, a move likely to boost testing rates further still.
But the unprecedented demand has put pressure on stocks of consumable material used in the conventional laboratory testing process.
In mid-March, the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy warned of temporary shortages, which he said were impacting “the scale of testing that we can do at the moment”.
About the same time, Murphy wrote to general practitioners warning them “the situation regarding pathology test kits, reagents and swabs is deteriorating rapidly, with kits no longer being available in some regions of the country”.
The government has also privately asked universities to search their campuses for any material that might be able to be used in testing, sought extra supply from abroad, and worked to ensure the supply chains of testing companies were secure.
Industry minister Karen Andrews said the government had been working “for some time” on developing domestic manufacturing options for Covid-19 testing materials. Friday’s callout to industry was simply an extension of that work, she said.

“Securing Australia’s testing capacity for Covid-19 is one of the Australian government’s highest priorities,” Andrews said. “We have secured vast amounts of testing kits from major international suppliers that is meeting current demand, while simultaneously working to ensure we build our domestic capability.”
“We have been working with Australian companies for some time to ensure supply and to look to develop domestic manufacturing options.”
No one has yet responded to the government’s callout – known as a request for information – in the short time since it was issued. But similar moves – including one to gauge interest in manufacturing PPE – have drawn a significant response.
The government has also approved a different type of test – an antibody test – which can rapidly return a result without the need for laboratory testing.
It has announced $2.6m for diagnostics research at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity to give a greater ability for widespread testing for diagnosis and clearance.
“Australia has one of the highest testing rates in the world and combined with our strict social distancing measures is helping to slow the spread of coronavirus,” Andrews said.

 Morrison has changed tack against his tribal instincts. But what happens after coronavirus? ","
After jettisoning key policies, embracing economic stimulus and taking a more decisive position on lockdowns and wages, the prime minister has enjoyed a resounding surge in personal support.
This turnaround echoes that of George Costanza, Jerry Seinfeld’s hapless sidekick, who hit a winning streak after committing to do the exact opposite of his every natural instinct.
So too Scott Morrison: the states forced him to be more decisive on lockdowns, especially schools, while unions and businesses prevailed on him to reverse his earlier opposition to wage subsidy. This followed his new conversion to Keynesian economics, most recently injecting billions into free childcare, a notion ridiculed by his team as communismbefore the last election.



The two meetings that changed the trajectory of Australia's coronavirus response

Full credit to Morrison and his government for changing tack and bringing more stakeholders to the decision-making table, but again this is something that would chafe with the PM’s natural, more tribal instincts.
The “big tent” leadership approach is that which the Rudd government brought to the GFC and Bill Shorten would have been expected to adopt if he had been successful at last year’s election when he ran on a “team” ticket. In contrast, Morrison’s shtick was one man and a baseball cap.
But these are unprecedented times, and as this week’s Essential Report shows, the public is ready to embrace someone who approaches leadership as a team game.
Do you approve or disapprove of the job Scott Morrison is doing as prime minister?
Like Costanza, the PM changed up from a position of relative weakness. The first weeks of the crisis had not been strong for the PM – the rating of 39% approval reflected the mixed messages, especially the Trumpian “I’m going to the footy” with a reluctance to step up distancing measures.
Thirty-nine per cent Morrison needed to play the team game. The question will be whether 59% Morrison recognises this cooperation is the foundation of his new authority or whether he reverts to typical Costanza-like behaviour.
The increase in approval for government comes in a week where the public appeared to (finally) twig to the reality of the crisis, with fewer people seeing the response as an underreaction. 
Through the crisis the trends of trust in both government and media continue to rise, while the personal financial concerns have abated somewhat since the announcement of the jobkeeper allowance.
For opposition leader Anthony Albanese, this is a difficult period for different reasons. Having been left out of the national cabinet, Albanese is forced to lead from the sidelines.
This is reflected in the relatively flat response to the opposition leader’s performance. No drop off with the increased satisfaction in the PM, but no statistical relevant increase in his standing either.
Do you approve or disapprove of the job Anthony Albanese is doing as opposition leader?
There are important roles for the opposition in the here and now, scrutinising government decisions without being seen to block; Labor’s role, for example, in the wage subsidy turnaround should not be underestimated.
But the political contest will be reloaded during the economic reconstruction. That’s where we will learn whether the responses to a crisis of working together to co-create solutions can prevail.
What will be the rules governing any “snap back”? How will the rights of workers and citizens be reinstituted after the crisis? As Greg Jericho argued over the weekend, talk of socialism is overblown, the government’s response still runs the risk of preserving interests of businesses over the interests of workers, and when “hibernation” ends there will be genuine contests over which will carry.



Don’t be fooled by Morrison’s benevolence – soon it’s back to tax cuts and smaller government | Greg Jericho

Will the tax system, for instance, continue to skew in favour of those with existing capital? Will the government persevere with its plans for a regressive flat tax? Who will bear the costs of bringing the budget back into balance?Will a party that has never believed in government have the wherewithal to think through ideas like joint equity and mutual ownership, or will they just revert to type and find the only solution in a corporate framework?
How will the government support new and newly relevant industries, as the reality of a globally constrained world demands new local capabilities and supply chains?
These broader questions, rather than the management of the crisis, will frame the choices voters make in 2022, a date that right now feels an eternity away.
The challenge in opposition right now is to think through and start the process of defining those choices.
Morrison will rightly gain plaudits for managing Australia’s response, providing he continues to temper his natural instincts to go one out and divide. But even Winston Churchill could not translate that leadership into re-election after the second world war ended.
George H Bush made it to 89% after the first Gulf war, only to lose the presidency to Bill Clinton two years later. Even his son hit mid-80s after 9/11.
The reality for both leaders is that support in a time of national crisis is ephemeral, politics unites for a time but there will be time for a renewed contest in the months to come.

In a WHO press conference, Lady Gaga said she had helped to raise $35m (£28m) for Global Citizen in the past week. She clarified that One World was not a fundraising telethon and would focus on entertainment and messages of solidarity, with fans urged to donate to the organisation ahead of the event.
The WHO’s general director, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: “We may have to be apart physically for a little while, but we can still come together virtually to enjoy great music. The One World: Together at Home concert represents a powerful show of solidarity against a common threat.”

A pair of Walmart workers have died from the coronavirus in a store in the Chicago suburbs, casting a grim spotlight on the risks faced by retail workers and causing concerns over whether large stores were taking enough care of their staff.
The two workers were assigned to a store in Evergreen Park, Illinois, according to the company.

“We are heartbroken to learn of the passing of two associates at our Evergreen Park store, and we are mourning along with their families,” Walmart confirmed in a statement.
Walmart did not identify the workers, or provide details on when or how they died.
According to store officials, the associates had not been in the Evergreen Park location “for more than a week”. It can take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear in infected individuals.
The coronavirus, which has infected nearly 350,000 worldwide and killed more than 9,600 people in the US so far, continues to wreak havoc on workers in industries deemed essential, including supermarkets and factories.

As the virus first made headway in the US, several workers at other Walmart locations told the Guardian they were concerned about working in crowded environments and whether the firm was putting concern for profits over safety.
“I’m 64 years old and according to the CDC, I should be staying home and practicing social distancing and in quarantine,” said a customer service manager, also in the midwest. “I can’t do that as I can’t afford to take off work unpaid.”
The worker opted to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.
Other workers shared reports of increased workloads, short staffing and a lack of sanitation protections or hazard compensation.
A Walmart spokesperson at the time referred to corporate press releases and an updated sick leave policy. Under it, workers are permitted to take unpaid time off if they don’t feel well.
Those diagnosed with coronavirus or quarantined can receive two weeks of paid sick leave.
The company announced 20 March it would hire 150,000 workers nationwide to meet demand. Full-time employees will receive about $300 each in bonuses.
Dan Bartlett, Walmart-vice president of corporate affairs, told reporters the company waited to secure protective gear to avoid further limiting equipment that could go to strained healthcare workers across the country.
He added the US’s largest grocer and private employer will need more than 7m masks each week for its employees. The first shipment will arrive in two weeks.
Last Friday, Walmart announced community protection measures including a reduced number of permitted customers in store, employee temperature checks and limited store hours to allow for cleaning and restocking.
Bartlett noted the company’s new measures were based on employee feedback, insisting leaders “try very hard to keep [their] finger on the pulse of [the] workforce”.

The news that Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital for tests on Sunday night with persistent coronavirus symptoms has shone a spotlight on the prime minister’s health.
While Johnson is not known to have any underlying health conditions, he has been open about his struggle with obesity – a known risk factor for coronavirus.
According to a report published last week, more than 70% of patients placed in intensive care after being infected with Covid-19 were overweight, obese or severely obese on the body mass index scale.
In December 2018, when Johnson was foreign secretary, he said in the Spectator that he weighed 16 and a half stone, which at 5ft 9in would have put him in the obese category. Johnson has lost weight since then, but it has fluctuated significantly throughout his political career.
Sonia Purnell, author of Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition, said that the prime minister’s usual wellbeing was striking. “By and large, he is remarkably fit considering he is actually a bit overweight,” she said. “He’s not really that active, his runs aren’t very long or very energetic and he is very fond of cheese. In fact, he likes eating a lot – nothing wrong with that – but he does have a very robust constitution. In the time I’ve known him since the 90s, illness has never really come up.”
Johnson became a devoted runner in the early 2000s. In his book Boris: The Rise of Boris Johnson, Andrew Gimson notes the prime minister also took up cycling in London in 1999 and quickly became “the most famous cyclist in Britain”. Gimson added that cycling had several attractions for Boris: “It was energetic, dangerous, anarchic.” While he was mayor of London, Johnson was involved in several near-miss accidents while cycling, including a 2009 incident in east London.
In 2013, Johnson went on a major health kick before taking part in the first Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100, a now annual closed-roads cycle ride out of the capital and into the countryside. At the start of his training regime, which he styled Operation Chiselled Whippet, Johnson, who was then 48, conceded that he was “pushing 17 stone, and since my normal cycling speed is so slow that my wife says it is a miracle I stay upright, I have decided to get in shape”.
When Theresa May made him foreign secretary in 2016, Johnson lamented the impact the job had on his lifestyle. While he was back on his bike after returning to the backbench, his cycling days were limited, as he would soon be entering No 10.
As well as jogging and cycling, Johnsonis a keen tennis player. At an auction for the Conservative party’s annual winter ball, a game of tennis with the prime minister was auctioned for £45,000.
Purnell traces Johnson’s appetite for sport to his childhood, when he was encouraged to run, jump, and play “whiff-whaff”, better known as table tennis. At Eton, he played rugby and cricket, and took part in the Wall Game, a sport unique to the private school.
More recently, Johnson is reported to have given up his running due to issues with his knees. The prime minister instead participates in online classes that include yoga and pilates.
Purnell says the hospital admission will be difficult for Johnson who, like his father, rarely admits to illness or notices it in others. “When I worked with him as his deputy [in the Daily Telegraph’s Brussels bureau], he was certainly very, very intolerant of illness in others, and considered it as sort of a weakness.”

The dramatic quietening of towns and cities in lockdown Britain has changed the way the Earth moves beneath our feet, scientists say.
Seismologists at the British Geological Survey have found that their sensors are twitching less now that human activity has been curtailed, leading to a drop in the anthropogenic din that vibrates through the planet.
The fall in the human hum that rings around the world means that, in theory at least, the scientists should be able to detect smaller earthquakes in the UK, and more distant tremors in Europe and in countries further afield than their equipment usually allows.

“Seismometers measure ground vibrations and the vibrations we want to record are from earthquakes. But because they are so sensitive they pick up other sources too, including human activity, so road traffic, people walking past and nearby factories,” said Brian Baptie, a seismologist at BGS in Edinburgh. “All these things generate vibrations and those propagate through the Earth.”
Human-induced vibrations, known in the trade as “cultural noise”, spread through the planet differently to tremors from earthquakes and tend to die away a few miles from their origins. But seismometers placed near urban centres still pick up plenty of noise that makes it harder for scientists to analyse the more valuable seismic data.



In theory, this reduction in noise means we should be able to detect more earthquakes in the UK, in Europe and all around the world
Brian Baptie, British Geological Survey

The UK’s network of sensitive instruments picked up markedly fewer vibrations last week as the coronavirus lockdown took hold, the researchers found. “We had a look at the data from some of our seismic stations around the UK and we do see an effect,” said Baptie. At some sensors, cultural noise is running at five decibels lower than normal, about a quarter down on usual readings. Similar falls have been spotted by Belgian seismologists based in Brussels.
The BGS operates a national network of about 80 seismometers from Shetland to Jersey that provide a constant ear to the ground. The data are pored over by BGS scientists and fed into a global network that is used to monitor earthquakes anywhere on the planet. In contrast to low-frequency tremors, cultural noise vibrations are high-frequency waves, around one to 100Hz, that tend to travel through the surface layers of the Earth.
“In theory, this reduction in noise means we should be able to detect more earthquakes in the UK, in Europe and all around the world,” said Baptie. If so, it would shed light on the frequency of different magnitude earthquakes and, in the case of more distant tremors, how the seismic waves are affected by the Earth’s structure and the characteristics of the shifting faults that unleash them.
Researchers at the BGS now hope to check all their seismometers for the fall in human noise with the aim of producing a map that will reveal which areas of Britain have seen the most stark declines in the human hum. The hunt for smaller earthquakes may take longer than the lockdown holds, however. “We aren’t in a particularly active region,” said Baptie. “So we may not get anything in the short term.”

Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:
Global death toll passes 70,000
The number of known cases around the world nears 1.3 million as the global number confirmed to have died hits 70,798, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. In all, 271,013 people are confirmed to have recovered after contracting the virus.
The true scale of the pandemic is likely to be greater as some countries are suspected of underreporting their figures.
More than 5,000 have died in UK hospitals
According to the country’s Department of Health and Social Care, 5,373 people who had tested positive for coronavirus have now died in UK hospitals. A total of 208,837 people have been tested for the virus, of which 51,608 tested positive, officials say.
While that appears to be a slower death rate than has been seen in recent days, the way the data is being reported is skewing the picture somewhat.
US prepares for ‘peak death week’
The accelerating American death toll closes the gap with Italy and Spain, prompting local officials to prepare the public for a high death toll.
Admiral Brett Giroir, a physician and a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, told ABC’s Good Morning America: “It’s going to be the peak hospitalisation, peak ICU week and unfortunately, peak death week.”
Coronavirus is EU’s biggest ever crisis - Merkel
The pandemic is the biggest test the bloc has faced in its history, Angela Merkel says. “Everyone is just as affected as the other, and therefore, it is in everyone’s interest, and it is in Germany’s interest for Europe to emerge strong from this test.”
Germany considers mandatory face masks
Wearing masks in public could soon be mandatory in Germany, according to a draft list of measures local officials think should allow life to return to normal. The proposals reportedly include an obligation to wear masks in public, limits on public gatherings and the rapid tracing of infection chains.
Hospitalised UK prime minister ‘in good spirits’
Boris Johnson, who was taken into hospital on Sunday, has tweeted that he is in “good spirits” after his tests.

Boris Johnson #StayHomeSaveLives 
(@BorisJohnson)
I’d like to say thank you to all the brilliant NHS staff taking care of me and others in this difficult time. You are the best of Britain. Stay safe everyone, and please remember to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.

UK antibody test ‘at least a month away’
A mass antibody test is at least a month away, a leading government scientific adviser in the UK has warned. Professor Sir John Bell, from Oxford University, who advises the government on life sciences, says the search is on for an antibody test that will prove effective, but those tested so far had failed.
The chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, says he is “very confident” that the UK will develop antibody tests “over the next period”, adding that it is not surprising that prototypes so far have failed.
Italy’s death toll accelerates again
The country had recorded the fewest deaths in any day for two weeks but Monday’s figures show the numbers accelerating again, with a further 636 new deaths; 111 more than the number registered on Sunday. That brings the toll in Italy to 16,523.
The number of current new infections increased by 1,941 – a rise of 2% since Sunday and the lowest day-to-day rise registered since 30 March.
Hopes rise in Greece
The latest figures released by health authorities in Greece offer a glimmer of hope. The prominent infectious diseases expert, Sotiris Tsiodras, says data suggests the country is “flattening the curve”.
UK plans for end of lockdown but too soon to say when
The country’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, says planning for the end of the lockdown is taking place, though it is too early to say when it could happen. And he warns: “The risk right now is if we take our focus off the strategy, which is beginning to work, we won’t get through this peak as soon as we want to.”

Matt Hancock says this country, unlike Germany, does not have the scale to undertake the testing required in the Covid-19 pandemic (Why has the UK lagged behind in testing for the coronavirus?, 3 April), and Public Health England (PHE) is being criticised for its lack of testing capacity. Yet between 1946 and 2003 the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) provided a network of over 50 laboratories that were the first line of defence in major public health outbreaks. Had this network been maintained, there would have had been more laboratories available. Instead, since 2003 this network has been dramatically reduced in favour of centralisation as a cost-saving venture, which has resulted in a lack of capacity for large-scale testing.
The Central Public Health Laboratory in north London (where most of the current testing is taking place) has also been much reduced in capacity, and many specialist staff have retired and not been replaced.
The PHLS became internationally recognised for developing progressive methods/technologies, evaluations of kits and equipment, and standardised methods (which I led from the mid-1990s). It is time for the government and PHE to rethink how an integrated microbiology laboratory system with standardised, validated methods should be operated to have the ability to respond to outbreaks like Covid-19.Valerie BevanChair, British Society for Microbial Technology
• While your editorial (2 April)(3 April) rightly challenges Matt Hancock’s “big business” explanation for Germany’s successful testing programme, the suggested need to look closely at the country’s institutional makeup only touches on the matter. Unlike the British, Germans may choose to have, funded through their insurance, annual health checks, which may involve sample testing, scans and investigative procedures. While clinicians in the UK may consider this unnecessary, and politicians too costly, the effect in Germany has been a huge expansion of testing facilities.
So the German health system has fast access to a wealth of public health information that has proved valuable in the present crisis. Germany has a proactive health system, while the UK’s remains largely reactive. An effective national health service depends on an efficient national health system. At present, the UK’s doesn’t, and as a consequence has been grossly unprepared.Dr Colin ColesWinchester

Aldi said it is urgently trying to contact a care worker in Scotland on Monday, who has claimed she was turned away from the supermarket when trying to buy food for an elderly client.
Marion Kilmurray posted a plea on Facebook for care workers to be treated as frontline workers, alleging that she was turned back from at an Aldi on Sunday in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, when trying to get bread for one of the women she cares for.
In response to the allegation, an Aldi spokesperson denied Kilmurray had been turned away.
“Carers are very welcome at all of our stores and we recognise the vital role they play in our local communities. Mrs Kilmurray wasn’t turned away from our Wishaw store so we are looking into what may have happened and are trying to contact her,” a spokesperson said.
The video was shared more than 100,000 times, but on Monday evening Kilmurray took it down from her Facebook page.
In the clip Kilmurray, sitting in her car in her carer’s blue uniform, claimed: “I went in to get bread for an elderly woman who can’t come out of the house because she has to self-isolate and I can’t get her bread because my uniform doesn’t count.”
In tears she said: “Do you think I want to be out here working? I’m trying to raise a family … I’m risking my life and my family’s life so get a grip and somebody do something about this.”
Aldi previously announced that emergency workers - those in the NHS, police and fire service - will receive priority access at any time of the day with appropriate ID, such as an NHS card. This means they can enter the store as soon as social distancing limits allow.
Aldi stores are also now opening half an hour earlier on Sunday mornings for emergency workers only.

Police officers have recorded early signs of an increase in suicides and attempted suicides during the lockdown, MPs have heard.
Sgt Simon Kempton, the operational lead for Covid-19 at the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents tens of thousands of rank-and-file officers, said it was too early to say if there was a clear pattern.
The remote hearing by the home affairs select committee also heard that around 13% of all police officers and staff were absent due to sickness, self-isolation or caring responsibilities, and that some forms of crime – such as burglary and other acquisitive crime – had dropped since the restrictions began.
Answering questions from the Labour MP Stephen Doughty about the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the police response to mental health callouts, Kempton said: “There are very early indications of an increase in suicide attempts and suicides – far too early to say if that’s a real trend, but there are early indications of that. Quite often the police are the agency who are trying to deal with that situation.”
He added: “One of the difficulties we’ve got as a police service is we’re losing staff to abstractions through self-isolation or sickness, so are the mental health services, so are social services, and it’s going to be all too easy for some of these people in real crisis to fall through the gaps as we see those staffing levels come under more burden, and it’s something we can’t lose sight of.
“At the moment we are coping but we’re starting to see in some areas, particularly in specialist areas, that burden starting to rise as we lose staff.”
Ch Supt Paul Griffiths, the president of the Police Superintendents’ Association, told the committee that police officers were reporting an increase in mental health incidents.
“We’re still waiting to see the data on the mental health incidents which we will still be dealing with, but anecdotally from our members we’re starting to see a slight increase, and if we continue to keep these isolating strategies in place there is a risk that mental health issues will increase over the coming weeks and months,” he said.
“We’re well versed with what our role is in terms of supporting members of the community in terms of their mental health challenges, working with other agencies such as health and social care and local authorities. It’s a well trodden in terms of what we can do to maximise support for those individuals who are probably going to see increased and more intense pressure in terms of their wellbeing.”
Griffiths told the committee there was currently an absentee rate across the police estate of 13%. The total workforce as of September last year, the most recently available official statistics, was 205,000. Thirteen per cent would therefore equate to around 26,650 staff.
Answering questions from Tim Loughton, Griffiths said no forces were yet reporting a risk to service provision.
He said: “The absence rate is approximately 13% across the whole of the national establishment – that includes police officers and staff. Some of those will be sick, some of them will be self-isolating with symptoms, some of them will have caring responsibilities.”
He added: “Even with that capacity issue, none of the police forces are flagging up anything they can’t cope with at this stage.”

Dozens of doctors in Pakistan protesting over a lack of safety equipment as they battle coronavirus have been arrested in the south-western city of Quetta.
Baton-wielding police broke up the demonstration on Monday by more than 100 doctors and paramedics denouncing shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and goggles.
Fifty-three medical staff were detained during the protest, which came as frontline medical workers around the world have been grappling with short supplies of vital safety equipment as the pandemic spreads.
A doctor and a nurse died last month in Pakistan after contracting coronavirus, while at least two dozen other medical workers in the country have recently tested positive for Covid-19.
In India, doctors wrote on Monday to the prime minister, Narendra Modi, complaining of a backlash against doctors who had spoken out over shortages of critical supplies.
The Resident Doctors Association of New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences, which represents 2,500 doctors, wrote that criticism of the country’s response to the outbreak was being muzzled.

The association’s general secretary, Dr Srinivas Rajkumar, said at least 10 doctors had been threatened by police, transferred or forced to resign.
“Don’t target doctors,” Rajkumar said.
The Indian government has ordered hundreds of thousands of pieces of protective equipment, but doctors have complained on social media that they have been forced to improvise their own kit.Dr Indranil Khan, a hospital oncologist in the eastern city of Kolkata, said he was questioned by police for 16 hours last month after deleting online posts that showed doctors using raincoats as protective gear.

The administration of northern Kashmir region, which is directly controlled by the federal government, said public criticism was “causing more harm than good” and has warned of strict action against those speaking to the media.
Coronavirus cases are rising steadily in India, and health experts warn of a further surge. As of Monday, India had recorded 4,281 cases, with 111 deaths.
Dr Suhail Naik, the president of a doctors association in Kashmir that represents about 3,000 members, said the administration must take the criticism positively.
“They can’t snatch this right [of free speech] from us,” Naik said.

The UK government must ensure pupils from poor backgrounds have computers and internet connections during the coronavirus lockdown or face legal action for depriving children of their education, according to a group of legal activists.
The Good Law Project argues that the widespread reliance on online learning during the lockdown is illegally disadvantaging state school pupils who lack access to tablets, laptops or adequate broadband. It says it will sue local authorities to try to push the government into action.
The move could lead to courts forcing the government to ensure the provision of adequate internet connections and IT equipment to hundreds of thousands of children from poor or vulnerable backgrounds while the lockdown continues and schools remain closed.
“Local authorities in England have a clear obligation to ensure that all children can access teaching, so there’s a very strong claim against them to ensure that they are doing so,” Jolyon Maugham, the Good Law Project’s founder, told the Guardian.
“Remember that the government hasn’t closed schools down, and because they are still teaching online then children who can’t access that teaching are missing out and likely to fall behind their peers. And that’s what we want to stop happening.”
In many families, children are sharing a tablet or laptop with siblings and working parents or have access only to mobile phones, while the internet access they might have had through schools, libraries or cafes has been cut off by the coronavirus crisis. Research published by Ofcom in 2018 suggested that as many as a million children and their families did not have adequate access to a device or connectivity.
The Good Law Project, which has won recent court victories against Uber that could lead to the ride-hailing service being held liable for £1.5bn in unpaid tax, is to back legal action against the London borough of Southwark on behalf of parents whose children attend state schools in the area, arguing that it has failed to meet its legal obligations.
“I have sympathy for the position of local authorities, who have found themselves landed with a new set of legal responsibilities to educate children remotely without matching funding from central government,” Maugham said. “Southwark is an inner-city local authority with a high percentage of children eligible for free school meals who we know to be unable to effectively access education online.”
Cassie Buchanan, the headteacher of Charles Dickens primary school in Southwark, said she supported the legal action. She has been concerned at how many children at her school and others are struggling to get appropriate access to technology for learning, often because the lockdown has meant children having to share limited equipment with adults working from home.
“We know from our own experience that for many families their only online access is via a parent’s phone. And we’ve designed our learning material to cope with that. But in secondary schools where the work is more interactive, these children really need to use a laptop and in many cases they can’t,” Buchanan said.
Buchanan said her school of 500 pupils had about 150 eligible for free school meals, and its multi-academy trust, the Charter Schools Education Trust, was lending out computers to secondary school pupils and asking parent to donate laptops or tablets that could also be loaned out.
“It’s more complex than just giving everyone access to a computer; they also have to access to broadband as well,” she said.

The lawyers say the obligations under the Education Act are “buttressed” by wider national responsibilities under the Human Rights Act and the United Nations’ convention on the rights of the child, to which the UK is a signatory, which establish access to education as a legal right.
The group is being advised by specialist education solicitors and two prominent human rights barristers, Caoilfhionn Gallagher and Adam Wagner of Doughty Street chambers, and is hoping to crowdfund an initial £25,000 to cover costs.
Maugham said the group would call for the government to step in with funding to avoid placing a further strain on local authorities, and would write directly to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, asking him to consider the issue.

Tens of thousands of British nationals are feared stranded in Pakistan, according to the shadow minister Emily Thornberry, as more than 75 MPs demanded action in a letter sent to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab.
Thornberry, a former shadow foreign secretary and now shadow international trade secretary, has been collecting data from Labour MPs who have been deluged with calls and emails from constituents. She has given Raab a detailed plan of action the party wants to see urgently enacted.
Her letter comes amid growing anger that the UK’s £75m airlift operation has resulted in charter flights to Peru, India, South Africa and Nepal but not Pakistan.
Osman Riaz, 33-year-old trauma surgeon at Pindersfield general hospital in Wakefield, is among those trying to get back.



Britons in Pakistan accuse UK government of abandoning them

He said he feels that Britons of Pakistani heritage are “being classed as second class citizens”, after being unable to obtain a return flight despite numerous calls to the embassy in Islamabad.
“I really hope the British government get their act together and start treating British citizens in Pakistan as equals to their counterparts in India,” he said.
A businessman willing to charter a plane with landing rights and logistical support is said to have offered his support.
Sam Tarry, the Labour MP for South Ilford, has spoken to him and said the offer had so far gone unheeded by the Foreign Office.

April 3, 2020

Thornberry’s letter to Raab, also signed by Jeremy Corbyn, the new deputy leader Angela Rayner and 73 other MPs, spoke of those who “desperately need to get home to access their essential medicines and self-isolate safely”.
“Many of these nationals are elderly, vulnerable and suffer from critical underlying conditions,” it said.
It expressed “concern that the high commission in Pakistan is not adopting examples of best practice that we have seen from other embassies around the world”, a reference to the immediate efforts made by countries such as Germany and France to evacuate citizens when travel restrictions started to be imposed around the world from the middle of March.

Businessman Syed Ahmed, a former director of UK Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has offered to send an Airbus 340 with landing rights and logistical support.Tarry said trying to mount a private charter was “a drastic measure” but it seemed a team of private entrepreneurs “ will be forced to act where the government has failed”.
The FCO said charter flights were being prioritised for citizens in countries where borders were closed and as Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) was still able to fly from the country, efforts were being directed towards the commercial option.
It said 1,000 Britons had returned to the UK last week on four PIA flights with eight more scheduled this week.
In relation to the offer of a charter flight it said the issue was not getting aircraft but the FCO settling on a strategy involving charter flights for countries where no other options existed.
However, those left behind have blamed an “appalling” lack of communication and transparency by the FCO for stress and loss of funds as passengers scramble to get on to PIA flights which are then cancelled.
Others say the government should not be outsourcing project management of emergency repatriation to an airline.
Shazia Ejaz, whose elderly parents are stranded after their flights on 23 March were cancelled, said: “These are elderly people who have paid tax all their lives and never relied on the government for anything and the one time they need them the FCO lets them down, but can help backpackers in Peru which you can imagine are not the most vulnerable.”Farhan Mirza, a 35-year-old research scientist whose mother is stranded said: “I’m really disgusted by the way Mum’s been treated. The FCO seem to think everyone stuck over there is a dual national and therefore not entitled to repatriation as in other countries, so we need to explore commercial options.”

His mother, Naseem, a 60-year-old social worker from Buckinghamshire, went to Pakistan on 10 March after her sister passed away only to discover her return flight had been cancelled. She has been diagnosed with low blood platelets and has said that if she is infected with coronavirus in Pakistan, she would not recover. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, promised an announcement on charter flights by the end of last week, but the information was disclosed on social media and on an update to the government website making it difficult to find for those who don’t use Twitter of Facebook or those who do not look at the gov.uk website.
The update said it had organised charter flights to Bolivia, Ecuador, Philippines and India with Norwegian, TUI and Ryanair joining the list or airlines involved.
The FCO has been approached for comment.

As the coronavirus rages through prisons and jails across the United States, attorneys, advocates and family members of California inmates are urging the state to release older prisoners and inmates with underlying health conditions for whom contracting the virus could have devastating consequences.
In response to the coronavirus threat, California has already fast tracked the release of almost 3,500 people serving sentences for nonviolent offenses who were due to be paroled in the next 60 days. The California Department for Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) has also taken coronavirus mitigation efforts like barring visitors, increasing facility cleaning, and producing hand sanitizer.
But cohorts of prosecutors, doctors, and criminal justice reformers are calling on state officials to step up their relief efforts for older and vulnerable prisoners, including those serving time for violent offenses.
Alicia Rhoden’s husband, Bruce Wayne Rhoden, has been in Wasco State Prison for about a month. In addition to his age, Bruce has a bevy of pre-existing conditions, including diabetes and HIV, that make him vulnerable to severe illness and death if infected with the coronavirus. Alicia, who’s 60 and has epilepsy, says she’s frightened that her husband will become ill while in prison and she won’t know about it until it’s too late.
“My husband is 61 and his health isn’t good at all,” Alicia Rhoden, a Los Angeles resident, told the Guardian. “My fear is that he can die in prison because of his medical conditions.”
“He needs a lot of care,” she added. “He takes six insulin shots a day and needs his antivirals.”
Hoping to force the state into action, attorneys with the Prison Law Office and Rosen, Bien, Galvan & Grunfeld are seeking to modify an existing court order that mandates California to reduce their prison population. In an emergency motion, filed on 25 March, the attorneys argued that vulnerable people like the ill and those over the age of 50 should be prioritized as the administration of the California Governor Gavin Newsom considers early releases because of the coronavirus.

“Excluding lifers who have served long periods of time and people with violent offenses is a waste of human life,” said Michael Bien, one of attorneys who filed the emergency motion.
“You should look at their current risk and behavior in the past 10-20 years,” continued Bien. “People make horrible mistakes but how many years must someone stay in a dangerous situation to make up for the horrible mistake?”
As of 2 April, eight inmates and 33 prison staff members at the (CDCR) have tested positive for Covid-19. While that number is small compared to the 48 cases and one death in a single Illinois prison and the nearly 200 cases at Rikers Island in New York, advocates worry that it’s just a matter of time before prisons in California see dozens of confirmed cases.
The CDCR houses around 116,000 inmates in prisons and camps, according to their most recent population report. Almost 5,600 are 65 years old or older and 37% of the total prison population have at least one of the risk factors that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say put them at risk of severe illness from Covid-19.
Age and underlying conditions combined with the lack of space in prisons are a “perfect storm of why this population that should be released early,” said David Muhammad, executive director of the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform of older prisoners.
“They’re most at risk, they cost the most to incinerate and care for, and have the lowest risk of recidivating,” Muhammad continued. (Federal inmates who were released after the age of 60 had a less than 10% reincarnation rate compared to over 30% for people under 30, according to a 2017 United States Sentencing Commission report.)
In a 31 March response to Bien’s motion, attorneys for the state say CDCR officials have “already taken immediate, bold, and appropriate steps in response to this rapidly evolving crisis.” The measures include moving around 500 people from dormitories, which are open spaces with bunk beds that hold dozens of inmates, to prisons with available space. They’ve also suspended intake from county jails, a process that usually brings 3,000 new people into the CDCR’s 35 adult institutions per month.
A spokesperson for the CDCR told the Guardian in an email that these steps along with the recent releases will, “help create physical distancing for all inmates, thereby reducing the risk of spread of Covid-19 among the entire population.”
But many worry that the state’s exclusion of people who have committed violent crimes – almost half of the CDCR population according to a 2018 department report – won’t reduce the elderly population enough to avoid an outbreak.
“It’s a risk to public safety if you don’t reduce the population, not the other way around,” said Adnan Khan, who after spending 16 years in San Quentin State Prison co-founded justice reform not-for-profit Re:Store Justice.
Khan, who was released in January 2019, says he stays in daily contact with friends that are still incarcerated, including his 68 year old mentor. Khan recalls a recent conversation where his mentor matter of factly told Khan that he and other prisoners are, “Just waiting to get the coronavirus. Those who survive do, and those who don’t, don’t.”
State officials say that releasing people from incarceration is a complicated process that begins more than six months before someone is allowed to walk out the prison’s gates. This process includes assessing post-release needs and getting people set up with state-funded benefits as needed. They argue that these pre-release plans are necessary to ensure that people can thrive post-incarceration and that this process should remain in the hands of corrections officials, not state courts.
Still, people like Khan and Rhoden worry that as the legal battle wears on, their loved ones will become more at risk while behind bars.
“My mom’s not young, and I’m worried about her getting sick there,” said Tamisha Torres, a re-entry service provider in California’s Contra Costa county.
Torres’ mother is 55 years old and incarcerated in Folsom State Prison, about 30 miles from Sacramento. She was accepted into one of the CDCR’s 3 Alternative Custody Programs, which are private residences or CDCR facilities with rehabilitative programs, to serve the rest of her sentence. But the rapid spread of coronavirus has prompted CDCR officials to stop the transfer of the people from prisons to these facilities. So Torres’ mother is continuing to work in the prison while she awaits her transfer.
“It’s devastating when you get a notice that you’re gonna be released and then it’s like “Oops sorry, the bus isn’t coming”, said Torres.
“Now my mom has to decide: ‘Am I going to go to work and risk getting sick in this place or am I not gonna have what I need to be comfortable here?’ If you’re in prison and don’t have someone taking care of you then going to work and getting that 35 cents an hour is everything,” Torres continued.
On Thursday a three-judge panel heard oral arguments on the emergency motion. Bien said that while court proceedings are moving rapidly compared to others that can go on for weeks or months, there is no telling what the panel will decide or when the ruling will come down.
“One of my concerns is my husband getting sick and no one telling me. I just find out that he’s dead, it gives me fear – that I might not know,” said Rhoden.
“And Bruce gets frightened because he doesn’t know if something happened to me. I’m epileptic and have 10 seizures a week. If I get too sick there will be no one to advocate for him,” continued Rhoden.
“We’re paying the price for mass incarceration in the United States,” echoed Bien. “This is a harsh lesson for all of us on how dangerous our systems are. It’s terrible for the people incarcerated, it’s terrible for the staff.”

Fragments (Beckett by Brook)
Is there a more fitting playwright for our current moment of isolation, uncertainty and endurance than Beckett? In this production, filmed at the marvellously atmospheric Bouffes du Nord in Paris in 2015, Peter Brook directs five Beckett shorts with a cast of three (Jos Houben, Marcello Magni and Kathryn Hunter). The production comprises Rough for Theatre I, Rockaby, Neither, Come and Go and Act Without Words II. Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days.

Smashed
At first sight they could be Pina Bausch’s dancers: a procession of performers wearing smart suits and enigmatic smiles, gliding across a stage filled with apples. Bausch’s company memorably balanced apples on their heads in Palermo Palermo, but as Smashed is created by those juggling supremos Gandini, the fruit is mostly in motion here. Their Bausch homage has the same childlike games, adult fantasy and bruised humour of the German choreographer’s work. Smashed is crisp, fresh and full of flavour. You may never look at an apple in the same way again …

Ghost Quartet
If you missed its run at Soho’s new Boulevard theatre, here’s a chance to savour Dave Malloy’s song cycle, filmed in New York in 2015. Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It’s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience – but you’ll have to pour your own I’m afraid.

Edward and Freddie Fox play father and son in An Ideal Husband; Eve Best is a memorable Mrs Arbuthnot in A Woman of No Importance; Kathy Burke directs Lady Windermere’s Fan; and Sophie Thompson is horrified by theatre’s most famous handbag in The Importance of Being Earnest.
Key Change
Open Clasp is a women’s theatre company aiming to “change the world, one play at a time”. Key Change, now available to stream online, is a fantastic introduction to their consistently impressive work with women who are on the margins of society; in this case, prisoners at HM Prison Low Newton, who devised the 2015 show with the theatre group over several months in order to break down stigma and enlighten audiences. It was filmed in partnership with The Space.
Whatever the Weather
Created for children aged three to seven by Rochdale’s touring theatre company, M6, this sweetly magical show is centred on an alpine weather house whose little male and female figures each pop outdoors depending on the weather (rain for him, sun for her). When the couple start to look after a nest of birds, Gilly Baskeyfield’s story and her jaunty production gently explore themes of family and shared responsibilities. A rainbow of a show, available throughout April. Read the full review.
The Metamorphosis
The Royal Opera House may have shut its doors but it has opened up its archive for a series of free streams on its Facebook and YouTube channels. These include the Royal Ballet performing Peter and the Wolf and, on 17 April, The Metamorphosis, a surreal and very gloopy staging of Kafka’s novella, choreographed by Arthur Pita and created for dancer Edward Watson.

5 Soldiers
Rosie Kay’s extraordinary 5 Soldiers: The Body Is the Frontline was staged in army drill halls around the UK, but, since its live stream is still available online, you can watch it from the comfort of your own sofa. Performing in close quarters to a score that mixes punk and opera, Kay’s phenomenal company bring home the horror of combat and disarm audiences.
The Wind in the Willows
Julian Fellowes, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe teamed up to deliver a merry new version of Kenneth Grahame’s classic, staged at the London Palladium in 2017, with Rufus Hound wearing 50 shades of green as Mr Toad. It’s available to stream online for free, with the option to donate to help provide financial and emotional support to theatre workers.
Girls Like That
London’s Unicorn theatre has a world-class reputation for theatre for young audiences and its production of Evan Placey’s Girls Like That gripped the roomful of teenagers I watched it with in 2014. It’s online in full and offers a raw account of adolescent anxiety, slut-shaming and self-belief. In-your-face theatre that stays in your mind.

Le Patin Libre
Think dance on ice and you’d imagine sequins and staggering TV celebrities, but the Canadian troupe, Le Patin Libre, has taken the art form into a new dimension. In their double bill, Vertical Influences, the skaters turned the rink into a mesmerising stage slowly decorated by the patterns cut by their blades.
Woke
LIVR is a subscription service that enables you to catch up on theatre in 360-degree virtual reality. Pop your smartphone into the headset they send you and experience a range of shows including Apphia Campbell’s Fringe First award-winning show Woke, which interweaves the stories of Black Panther Assata Shakur and the 2014 Ferguson riots.

John Leguizamo’s Latin History for Morons
Self-isolation may mean that many of us will use living rooms to both teach children and watch theatre. An opportunity to combine the two can be found courtesy of the super-charismatic John Leguizamo – an inspirational tutor if ever there was – whose one-man Broadway show, Latin History for Morons, is on Netflix.
Cyprus Avenue
On Friday 27 March, to mark World Theatre Day, the Royal Court released an online version of David Ireland’s blistering play Cyprus Avenue, starring Stephen Rea as a Belfast loyalist who is convinced his baby granddaughter is Gerry Adams. The film mixes the drama shot at the Royal Court with location scenes of Belfast.

Timpson: The Musical
Two households, both alike in dignity … well, sort of. Our narrator, a talking portrait, lays our scene in Victorian London, and this musical comedy imagines the founding of the popular shoe-repair chain as a union between two companies, the Montashoes and the Keypulets. Watch Gigglemug Theatre’s show on YouTube.
My Left Nut
This is cheating as it’s a TV series, but BBC Three’s superb comedy drama is based on one of the most uproarious and affecting fringe theatre shows of recent years. It’s based on Michael Patrick’s own teenage experience of a medical condition that left his testicle “so big you could play it like a bongo”. Wince.

Five sublime minutes about absolutely nothing at all
Phil Wang: Andy Daly’s routine about nothing

Jerry O’Hearn (Andy Daly) at MaxFunCon 2011
Andy Daly’s mock standup routine about nothing at all has a cult following among comedy fans. The US comic, a regular on shows including Conan, steps into character as bland-but-confident observational comic Jerry O’Hearn. And somehow he is able to create five incredibly funny minutes without once actually saying anything specific.
I first saw the routine about eight years ago. There’s a YouTube clip of a bootleg recording tagged: “Jerry O’Hearn (Andy Daly) at MaxFunCon 2011.” Daly is quick to establish O’Hearn’s outlook: “All this stuff that’s going on in the world today? You gotta be kidding me!” What follows is ambiguous, meaningless standup that is nevertheless delivered with the self-righteous bafflement of a man convinced he is setting the world to rights. It’s a detail-free jaunt through every classic standup subject, running on gusto alone.
The routine is not just very entertaining, though. From a nerdier technical perspective, it’s amazing to see that standup, stripped entirely of any actual content, can still be recognisable as standup. Watching that clip, with its glaring light and distant sound, one gets the pleasure of a niche discovery – of something unique, daring, clever, silly and gloriously vague.

Paul F Tompkins’ Peanut Brittle routine
When I was in my teens, big acts rarely travelled to New Zealand, so I enjoyed most of my standup through comedy albums I borrowed from the library or CDs bought from the shop. My favourite was the 2007 album Impersonal by the US comic Paul F Tompkins.
My most listened-to track was Peanut Brittle. The entire routine is about those novelty cans labelled peanut brittle that actually contain spring-loaded snakes. The skit is completely perfect, flowing seamlessly between observations about the stupidity of the product and impressions of execs trying out new fonts for the can to keep the product relevant. It culminates in a lengthy section where Tompkins becomes a naive recipient of the can, oblivious to the prank within.
I attribute most of my comedy taste and style to this routine. I learned so much about rhythm from Tompkins. Great standup requires an equal balance of strong performance and strong writing: when you see the perfect alchemy of those, it feels like actual magic. I love Tompkins for all the reasons I love comedy: he makes the obscure or niche into something relatable, with stupid voices, SHOUTING, and a celebration of shared human experience. That’s comedy, baby!

Maria Bamford’s Celebrity Homes
Back in 2006, when I was performing at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal, I was still quite naive and nervous about standup. It all felt blokey and loud. But then, backstage at a gig, I saw a comic who looked really nervous and thought: “Oh, there’s someone a bit like me.” Her name was Maria Bamford and she made me realise there were other comics out there doing material about their personal insecurities. When she talked about how she perceived the world, I found it so inspiring.
I saw her Burning Bridges tour at Edinburgh that year. There was one routine, Celebrity Homes, that I particularly loved. It was based on those US TV shows about famous people’s houses that are always presented as: “I’ve got a huge house, you’d love to see it!”
She did a perfect impression of those shows, then another as if they’d come to her own home, an apartment. “Let’s go sit on the futon, look through the bars on the window, and watch the helicopters circle!” It really summed up the contrast of her very real world compared to the shiny TV world often portrayed on screen.
It took me a long time to learn that you need to be confident in your own insecurities for people to want to listen to them – and Bamford helped with that. Her comedy is alternative standup at its finest – storytelling from the outside looking in.

‘I would go out and re-enact the routine with my own penknife’
John Kearns: Eddie Izzard’s Swiss Army Knife

Eddie Izzard’s Swiss Army Knife routine
I first heard the Swiss Army Knife routine on the radio in my dad’s car. I was being dropped off at the cinema but remember thinking the film could wait, as Eddie Izzard went through each instrument of war on his knife one by one: “I can see you with my magnifying glass!” I was giddy with how silly it all was.
His Swiss accent instantly makes you want to do one yourself: “My little saw!” I would re-enact the routine with my own penknife. How that looked out on Tooting Bec Common, I don’t know. The routine is only about a minute long yet its impact was great. When you stumble across a comedian, and are still too young to realise how famous they are, a skit can feel like it’s been tailor-made for you. It’s your secret and you’re torn between sharing it or keeping it to yourself.
Swiss Army Knife is part of Glorious, a film of a gig Izzard did in 1997 that is striking for its ambition and scope. Beginning with the Old Testament and ending with Armageddon, he roots everything in the tiniest of details. On the first day God created “baked potatoes and crinkly things … very small avenues … toilets in French camping sites”.
What’s so inspiring about the Swiss Army Knife routine, and the entire Glorious album really, is the amount of work that must have gone into it. Not a word is wasted, nothing is left to chance. In this great showcase of life’s tiny absurdities, there must have been hours and hours of failure before he perfected the sound of a tiny saw going back and forth. It’s a reminder to me that there are no short cuts in comedy. Only hard work can make a performance look so effortless.

The fight for equality – with scissoring jokes
Lou Sanders: Michelle Wolf’s Women are Their Own Worst Enemies

Michelle Wolf on Late Night with Seth Meyers. The Women Are Their Own Worst Enemies routine is
available on Netflix
Last Christmas I sat down to watch Michelle Wolf’s latest Netflix special, Joke Show. About 30 minutes in, the US comedian talked about how women will never be equal with men because we judge each other so harshly instead of sticking together. That’s something I think about a lot.
Wolf is surprisingly critical of women giving men a hard time. For example, if a guy is manspreading, she says, he’s not doing it maliciously – he’s just not thinking. It reminded me of when I was on a long-haul flight. I was in the middle seat with a woman one side and a man the other. The man was really dominating my space: two armrests, heavy breathing, that kind of thing. I didn’t ask him to move because I’m an idiot. I just moaned to the woman that he was in my space and rolled my eyes. When we landed, I found out they were a married couple! They’d made me sit between them, the mad twots.
I’m making it sound dry, but the routine’s actually funny and wise – with lots of silly jokes about women scissoring. Since everyone is represented equally heinously, guys can’t be offended. She’s tearing us all a new one. The routine’s a manifesto, except Wolf also jokes about how the kind of people who write manifestos are wackos. So it’s not really a manifesto. It’s just good standup.

Kae Kurd: Eddie Murphy’s Italians After They See Rocky

Eddie Murphy’s Italians After They See Rocky
I first watched Raw, the film of Eddie Murphy doing standup in the 1980s, when I was about 16. I found it on YouTube, which is how I discovered most comedy when I was a teenager. There are few people that can do voices and act-outs so well. He does an Italian guy coming out of a cinema and telling another guy about watching Rocky.
“You know what I like about Sly’s movies?” he says. “The realism.” I used to crack up every time I heard that. This dude, who’s obviously not a film critic, is trying to intellectualise the film to suit his own narrative. At times, it doesn’t even feel like it’s Eddie any more: you feel like this character has become real. He has such flair: it all seems so effortless as he makes every character feel authentic and unique. Even if they have a similar accent, they have different voices and distinctive mannerisms.
When I was in school, I would do a lot of voices and impressions. I’d spend hours watching Eddie to see how he created a character. There was always a purpose to the voices and impressions: they formed a story or were part of a situation. There is no point doing impressions just to show people you can do them. What’s their purpose?
It made me understand that people love things they can relate to. I’ve tried to stay true to that. I love that routine because he’s not trying to preach to you like a lot of modern comics do. It’s just Eddie Murphy being effortlessly funny.

As of 23 March, the FCO has been advising UK nationals who are travelling abroad to return home immediately if commercial flights are still available.
This article was first published 28 February and is being updated daily. It was last updated at 4.45pm (GMT), 6 April.
If UK nationals who are usually based in the UKare urged to return if possible:
“International travel is becoming very limited as air routes close, land borders close and new restrictions are put in place that prevent flights from leaving,” the FCO website says. “We are working with airlines to keep routes open, and calling for international action to keep routes open to enable British people [to] return home on commercial flights. We are also working around the clock to support those British travellers who are already finding difficulties in coming back to the UK. If you are a permanent resident overseas, you should stay and follow the advice of the local authorities in the country you live in.”
UK nationals who are unable to return home should follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise exposure. This may include remaining in a hotel room or other accommodation for 14 days; being moved to quarantine facilities; being tested for coronavirus and, if positive, in some cases being admitted to hospital. Travellers with visa enquiries or visas that may soon be expiring should contact local immigration authorities in the country or the UK-based embassy.
On 30 March, the government announced it was partnering with airlines to charter flights to help bring stranded UK nationals home. Details will be published on the FCO travel advice pages and here when available. In some cases, the government may be able to offer an emergency loan to pay for flights back to the UK.

The boss of JP Morgan, Wall Street’s biggest bank, has said the world faces a “bad recession” as he took a swipe at America’s lack of preparedness for the pandemic.
In his annual address, written a month after he underwent emergency heart surgery, Jamie Dimon said that at the very least a severe downturn was on its way coupled with financial pressures reminiscent of the banking crash more than a decade ago.
“We don’t know exactly what the future will hold – but at a minimum, we assume that it will include a bad recession combined with some kind of financial stress similar to the global financial crisis of 2008.”
He said JP Morgan had not asked for any government support and would continue lending money, while offering greater forbearance for customers struggling to repay debts. But he admitted that even Wall Street’s largest bank “cannot be immune” to the economic turmoil and could be forced to suspend the dividend it pays to shareholders.
The banker has previously clashed with Donald Trump after claiming that he could beat the president in an election. And Dimon appeared to criticise the Trump administration’s lack of readiness for the outbreak.
“There should have been a pandemic playbook,” said Dimon.
But he also pointed to much deeper, structural problems in US society that he said were contributing to the danger presented by coronavirus.
“Of course, America has always had its flaws,” said Dimon. “The current pandemic is only one example of the bad planning and management that have hurt our country.”
Dimon, whose cash-plus-stock pay package was worth $31.5m (£25.6m) last year, highlighted worsening wealth inequality as one of America’s biggest problems, citing the fact that the share of wages for the bottom 30% of US citizens has been declining.
The JP Morgan boss also lamented poor outcomes in education, a costly healthcare system that many people cannot access, the lack of a social safety net and a poor immigration policy.
“We need to acknowledge these problems and the damage they have done if we are ever going to fix them,” said Dimon, who returned to work this year after heart surgery.
“As we have seen in past crises of this magnitude, there will come a time when we will look back and it will be clear how we – at all levels of society, government, business, healthcare systems, and civic and humanitarian organisations – could have been and will be better prepared to face emergencies of this scale.”
JP Morgan reported profits of $36.4bn last year and Dimon said the bank could survive and keep lending, even if its most pessimistic scenarios for the effect of the pandemic on the global economy came to pass.
But its dividend could be suspended in the “extremely adverse scenario” in which the US economy shrinks by 35% in the second quarter and unemployment hits 14% by the end of the year.

In addition, the board has “requested discussions” to defer payments due to the pension fund. A spokesman for the company said Reach paid £4.1m a month relating to the pension fund. According to the latest annual report for 2019, Reach had a pension deficit of £295.9m and made £48.9m in payments.
“The board has agreed that all stakeholder groups should be asked to contribute to ensuring the company is in as strong a position as it can be and as a result the company has requested discussions around a deferment of current contributions to all the group pension funds,” the company said.
While the company has said that everyone must play their part, Jim Mullen, the chief executive, and Simon Fuller, the chief financial officer, were paid almost £300,000 in bonuses for 2019 at the end of last month.
In addition, late last month the pair were given shares worth £1.18m on the day of the award relating to the company’s long-term incentive scheme, which will vest in three years.
A number of British publishers including the London financial freesheet City AM and JPI Media, the owner of the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post, have suspended printing some titles.

Reach said all of its print and digital publications “continue to be produced without interruption”.
“All of our key national and regional publications will continue to operate at this vital time despite these measures and we have sought to spread the burden of these actions across all stakeholder groups,” the company said.
Mullen said: “It remains difficult to predict the duration and long-term impact of the crisis on our sector, so it is key we take proactive measures now on cost to protect jobs and the Reach business for the long term.”
The company has £20m in cash and a £65m revolving credit facility it can utilise.
DMGT, the publisher of the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, Mail Online, the i and Metro, has taken a different, innovative approach to avoid furloughing staff or making redundancies.
The company, which has 2,400 staff working in its publishing arm, has asked employees to take a temporary pay cut in return for shares in the company.
The scheme will see staff on salaries above £40,000 take a graduated pay cut, ranging from 1% to 26%. Staff will receive a proportionate number of DMGT shares each month until the crisis is over. At the end of the year they will be able to cash in the shares, and if the share price has dropped the company will make up the difference, or they can hold on to the shares as an investment. Those earning less than £40,000 can also participate in the scheme of they choose.
“You will not have lost a penny,” said Jonathan Harmsworth (Lord Rothermere), who chairs and controls DMGT, in an email to staff on Monday. “Many news organisations are being forced to furlough staff and introduce redundancies. We have striven hard to come up with a plan that allows us to avoid these actions.”

The coronavirus lockdown has seen parks close their gates, cafes shut down and gyms are no longer open.
Life in the UK has changed like never before in peacetime. People have been told to stay at home where possible and only leave for exercise alone or with members of their household, or to shop for necessities; as key workers continue to work in social care, construction, the media and a number of other industries.
Meanwhile, couples who live separately have had to decide whether to move in together or remain apart for the duration of the measures, and house shares have been plunged into unchartered territory.
Accessible green spaces are few and far between in many places while millions of people do not have gardens, making the affects of the lockdown particularly acute in towns and cities.
We’d like to hear from young people, anyone up to the age of 25, about how life has changed under the lockdown – particularly in urban areas – and how they are managing to get by.
Share your experiences
How have you been affected by the lockdown? What is your daily routine like? How are you exercising? Have you been approached by police? Have you always abided by the rules? Have you made any home improvements? How has life changed in your home? Do you have children? How are you keeping them occupied?

Almost three-quarters of new electricity generation capacity built in 2019 uses renewable energy, representing an all-time record. New data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) shows solar, wind and other green technologies now provide more than one-third of the world’s power, marking another record.
Fossil fuel power plants are in decline in Europe and the US, with more decommissioned than built in 2019. But the number of coal and gas plants grew in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In the Middle East, which owns half the world’s oil reserves, just 26% of new electricity generation capacity built in 2019 was renewable.
The world has invested about $3tn in renewables over the past decade, according to Irena, but annual investments must double by 2030 to tackle the climate emergency.
Almost 75% of new electricity capacity was renewable in 2019
“While the trajectory is positive, more is required to put global energy on a path with sustainable development and climate mitigation,” said Francesco La Camera, director general of Irena. “At this challenging time, we are reminded of the importance of building resilience into our economies.”
La Camera said the huge spending planned by governments in response to the coronavirus pandemic must support green initiatives rather than fossil fuels. “In responding to today’s crisis, governments may be tempted to focus on short-term solutions,” he said. “Yet distinctions between short-, medium- and long-term challenges may be deceptive. The pandemic shows that delayed action brings significant economic consequences.”
The global oil market is in turmoil, hit by collapsing demand due to Covid-19 lockdowns and a savage price war between Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US. La Camera said: “Renewable energy is a cost-effective source of new power that insulates power markets and consumers from volatility.” Solar and wind power are now the cheapest form of electricity in two-thirds of the world.
The Irena data shows the increase in new renewable energy capacity slowed slightly in 2019 - from 179GW to 176GW – but that new fossil fuel power also fell. The total green energy installed to date around the world grew by 7.6%, with the UK’s total rising 6.1%. The UK is now 11th in the world for installed renewables.
New solar power provided 55% of the new capacity, most of which was installed in Asia, with China, India, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam leading the way. Other major increases were seen in the US, Australia, Spain, Germany and Ukraine.
Wind power made up 34% of the total, with almost half in China and significant additions in the US. Global wind power capacity remains just ahead of solar, with 95% being onshore turbines.
Other green technologies – hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal and marine energy – all grew modestly year-on-year. While small compared with solar and wind power, geothermal energy – tapping the heat of deep rocks – is growing, with Turkey, Indonesia and Kenya leading the way.

 This crisis has changed our experience of home – and exposed the deep pain of poor housing ","
How does your garden grow? My local neighbourhood app is full of people swapping compost while my Facebook feed is full of photos of daffodils – little explosions of hope and rebirth. Who can resent that? Well, quite a few people, actually; the hashtag #selfishpricks has been trending on Twitter. The selfish pricks are people who go to parks and don’t observe social distancing. This may well be selfish, but another kind of selfishness is growing alongside it, from those who fail to recognise many people don’t have outside space. To live through this pandemic is to feel this viscerally; so much inequality is being played out.
One can refuse this knowledge or fake it. Every time I see a Tory minister saying they know what it’s like being indoors all day with small kids, I catch myself thinking: “What do you actually know? Have you ever lived in a tiny flat with small kids and no garden? Do you really know what it is like not to have a tiny scrap of land where you can sit outside, set up a swing and still know you’re at home?” I lived this way with two kids until my mid-30s. The memory of acquiring a small concrete yard stays with me. To this day, I cannot garden, but to be able to sit outside is a luxury.



Rumblings about a clampdown on going outside to exercise are alarming, not so much for those with gardens but for those deprived of them

Sure, selfish pricks exist among the various kinds of outlaws who feel themselves invincible. But there are also those who just want to get out and have nowhere else to go. In some cases the parks, the green lungs of our cities, are being shut down. High-density living is what brings us to cities and now that we must stay apart, the division between the private and public space is being played out in this bizarre inability to acknowledge that many do not have private outside space: that they rely on a communal “outdoors” that is now to be avoided and policed. It is also finally being acknowledged that home is sometimes where the hatred is. Just look at the horrendous rise in domestic violence.
Cicero said if you have a garden and a library you have everything you need. I wonder if Cicero ever lived on the 17th floor of a tower block, as I once did. The recent rumblings about a clampdown on going outside to exercise are alarming, not so much for those with gardens but for those deprived of them.
I use the word deprivation because the first council houses often had three bedrooms, with both front and back gardens, and only later became boxes with small windows. Socialists once thought nothing was too good for working-class people, but as a popular, mainstream notion that is now ancient history. Now people pay high rents to live in cramped studio flats and public space has been mostly commodified. Dry discussions about urban planning have excited few; it’s the results that excite people, and we rarely see those.
I lived in King’s Cross in north London when it was scuzzy and magical and possibly dangerous. Now it is a giant shopping mall with an art school plonked in the middle and £5 flat whites. Sure, you can sit outside Waitrose and drink if you want to, because everything else is so expensive. Right now, it is a dead space, an unpopulated mall, a ghost town of obsolete ambition.



Going out to exercise means different things to different people. The advice should have been put simply: 'Don’t sit down'

Meanwhile, there are fist fights in small Co-ops. In south London, the 50-hectare Brockwell park is closed. There are those snitching on people they consider to be endangering us; the people out having a picnic in the sun could be killing nurses. The state of our mutual unravelling is not surprising when the advice has been so vague. Clearly going out to exercise means different things to different people, especially for those who have suddenly taken it up and are panting on a pavement near you. The advice should have been put simply: “Don’t sit down”.
The Queen, owner of infinite space, gets on the telly to tell us we must pull together. She speaks to us from a monstrous castle. Her brooch alone could buy a lot of oxygen. The national myth of exceptionalism is regurgitated by this owner of acres of this country.



Building and Dwelling by Richard Sennett review – sharp insights







Read more





The little people own no space, but we must imagine anyway: an end to this and a better life to follow. Donald Winnicott, the psychoanalyst and paediatrician, said, of his observation of children, that when we are deprived it is imagination that eases anxiety – we imagine a life beyond our boundaries and we expand.What the pandemic reveals is that the free market has led to the foreclosure of such imagination. The great writer and thinker Richard Sennett has long been talking about the relationship of social infrastructure to physical infrastructure, arguing that neither of these things can be delivered top down either by “welfare” or the market. He is right.
I am looking at the space for new thinking now, at a time when the crisis has accelerated every inequality. A basic one is between who has a garden and who does not, but it is really about: who owns what? Land, streets, malls, squares?
The wealthy squabble over their vistas as they always have, while our fellow citizens have nothing but four walls. The common good of lockdown means that we can finally see “the common good” is an actual space that many have been locked out of for a very long time.
In The Great Gatsby, when the millionaire Jay Gatsby is preparing for lunch with Daisy Buchanan, he has the scrappy lawn of the narrator, Nick Carraway, completely removed. He prefers a manicured look. “There was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker expanse of his began,” says Carraway.The line is indeed sharp.

"58","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-free-speech-hungary-fake-news","2020-04-06T11:27:46-0400","  
 Don't let free speech be a casualty of coronavirus. We need it more than ever ","
In times of crisis, liberal democratic institutions and values are vulnerable to authoritarian power grabs, or corona coups, as we are seeing around the world today. One of the first victims, as always, is freedom of speech. But the current attack on free speech is particularly dangerous, because it does not only target, reasonably, “fake news” on coronavirus, but also critique of inadequacies in hospitals by healthcare workers.
Repressive measures against fake news have been a popular topic for years now, having reached feverish levels in the wake of the 2016 US presidential elections. Even though the actual effects of “fake news” and “Russian interference” remain unclear and highly disputed, many mainstream politicians have convinced themselves that the spread of fake news is one of the main reasons that they are losing votes and power to populists.



UN secretary general: recovery from the coronavirus crisis must lead to a better world | António Guterres

Social media platforms are pressured into “fighting fake news” and a true cottage industry of factcheckers has emerged – many reputable, some not. Still, too little progress has been made. This is not that surprising, though, given the daily barrage of fake news coming out of some of the most powerful political offices in the world, including Downing Street and the White House.
Since the term was popularized by Donald Trump, it should come as no surprise that populists in power have enthusiastically embraced the fight against “fake news”. And now the coronavirus has given them an opportunity to intensify that fight by passing draconian new laws, allegedly to prevent fake news from worsening the crisis.
One of the worst examples, as so often in recent years, comes out of Hungary, where the rubber stamp parliament has passed a set of “emergency measures” – without actually facing an emergency (as of 31 March, Hungary has officially had only 492 cases, including 16 deaths) – to give the far-right prime minister Viktor Orbán “dictatorial powers”. As Orbán rules by decree, anything that he deems “fake news” will be punishable to up to five years in prison – a death sentence for independent media, in so far as it still exists in Hungary.
Perhaps even more dangerous is the attack on the free speech of people at the frontlines of the fight against the coronavirus: healthcare workers. These are the people best informed about the situation, and thus the best potential antidotes to fake news. Yet, according to the Independent, British NHS doctors are being gagged over protective equipment shortages, while NHS England has taken control of communications for many NHS hospitals and staff.
In the US, one of the few western democracies without a universal public healthcare system, individual private hospitals are doing the censoring. Prioritizing their brand and profits over the health of their patients and staff, private hospitals across the US have threatened staff with termination if they speak out about the lack of protective gear. Several hospital staff have already been fired after speaking out, an incredible waste of crucial but sparse resources during a pandemic.
Leaving aside the problem of employers regulating the speech of their employees, incidentally an increasingly common development (even at universities), censoring healthcare professionals is outright dangerous to the broader community. These are the people who actually have day-to-day experience with the coronavirus and risk their lives to help others – particularly if their employers don’t provide them with adequate protective gear.



Free speech makes us more rather than less safe, both as citizens and patients

Moreover, we know how dangerous this type of censorship is from recent experiences in China. Max Fisher has written an excellent New York Times exposé of how China’s authoritarian structure had worsened the country’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. And western media have devoted ample attention to the tragic case of Li Wenliang, the Chinese whistleblower doctor who died of the coronavirus in February.
The irony is that some of the same politicians who support, or at least allow, the censorship of healthcare professionals in their own country have been outspoken critics of the Chinese approach. For instance, the British cabinet minister Michael Gove recently blamed China for failing to stop the spread of coronavirus, while Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House foreign affairs committee, even called China’s response “one of the worst cover-ups in human history”.
To ensure that we are not making the same mistakes as China, and to protect the health and lives of the heroic healthcare workers (including the many volunteers) who are putting their lives on the line every day to keep us alive and healthy, we must resist these dangerous attacks on free speech, as well as other unnecessary authoritarian measures in response to the coronavirus crisis. Irrespective of the hype about fake news, free speech makes us more rather than less safe, both as citizens and patients, even in times of a health crisis.

EasyJet has secured a £600m loan from the Treasury and Bank of England’s emergency coronavirus fund, as the airline’s founder and biggest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, claimed it would run out of cash by the year end regardless.
The airline said it would also borrow another $500m (£407m) from commercial creditors to ensure its liquidity, with its fleet grounded for at least April and May due to the pandemic.

Thank you for your feedback.

The announcement came as Haji-Ioannou, who with his family owns just over a third of easyJet shares, demanded an emergency general meeting and called for the sacking of two directors.
The Cypriot tycoon relaunched his attack on the airline’s management and its order for 107 “useless” planes from Airbus, saying his “main objective is to terminate the £4.5bn Airbus contract”.
In a statement issued before confirmation of easyJet’s government loan, Haji-Ioannou had claimed that even remaining solvent until August – based on financial analysis that assumed flying would be quickly embraced again by holidaymakers this summer – could prove “wildly optimistic”.
When international travel eventually restarts, he said, the airline would “feel more like a startup trying to find a few profitable routes for a few aircraft”.
After news of the new financing, a spokesman for Haji-Iannaou said that it did not change the underlying situation, without cancellation of the Airbus order: “Given the current cash burn – that probably pushes the insolvency boundary back from August to late-autumn, early winter.”
EasyJet is understood to be in talks with Airbus to review the £4.5bn contract and reduce its ongoing spend.
The chief executive of easyJet, Johan Lundgren, said: “We remain absolutely focused on ensuring the long-term future of the airline, reducing our costs and preserving jobs, to make sure easyJet is in the best position to resume flying once the pandemic is over.”
He said the airline had now reached agreements with unions to furlough UK-based pilots and crew. About 4,000 of 9,000 will be furloughed during April and May.
Lundgren added: “Our current priority is to safeguard short-term liquidity … in the event of a prolonged grounding of the fleet.”

EasyJet has used the government’s Covid-19 corporate financing facility, which allows UK businesses to apply for loans at pre-crisis commercial rates.
The aviation sector had called for special government measures to help it survive, but the Treasury has been unwilling to assist airlines until wealthy shareholders dig deep.
The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said he would consider companies on a case-by-case basis, “only if all commercial avenues have been explored, including raising capital from existing investors”.

However, Haji-Ioannou, whose family received a near £60m share of £171m paid in dividends last month, said: “For the avoidance of doubt, I will not inject any fresh equity in easyJet whilst the Airbus liability is in place.”
EasyJet is likely to explore ways of resisting his calls for an emergency meeting, which it said would be “an unhelpful distraction”.

 Lockdown's hottest viral trends: raging at the neighbours and torching 5G towers ","
Who isn’t fascinated with infection rate graphs right now? My own loose theory is that you could use them to track much more than just the spread of coronavirus: change the label on the x axis and every one of them could easily represent data on how many people in the UK are currently getting too into jigsaws, for example, or growing very weak moustaches, or grappling with a sourdough. (The frighteningly steep lines depicting the out-of-control spread of new cases also neatly illustrate the world’s horniness pandemic – with everyone locked inside and the rising sap of spring, this is arguably the most sexually desperate moment in all of human history. Look at the graphs. The planet has never been hornier.)
The graphs are also neatly tracking two other viral trends right now: “being extremely furious at your neighbours” and “burning down a 5G tower because Facebook told you to”. Both have really skyrocketed this week – we are outperforming even Italy in burning down our 5G towers! – but also have yet to reach a pinnacle, let alone a long curve down. We’ll take each one in turn.
First, Neighbourhood Watch has now gone nuclear. Britain has always had a fine tradition of curtain-twitching – does any other culture have such reverence for net curtains, to comment on people’s parking, how big their weekly shop is, how often their grownup daughter does or does not visit with the kids?
In lockdown, the government has given us all a gift by issuing behavioural guidelines but not actually making them sovereign – so we all get the pleasure of helping to enforce the rules. What that should mean in theory is we come together as a great neighbourly morass, pooling resources and scheduling our trips to help the infirm and the quarantined, one great big blitz spirit effort to get through this, together. What it actually means is once a week we all get furious at each other about going to the park.
Even I have fallen into this trap, and I’m normal. More than once this week I’ve been out on my still-permitted daily walk and thought: “Wow, a lot of people in this park. Go home, idiots.” I have thought that thought, while in a park, presumably while other people in the park have looked at me and thought: “Wow, look at that guy in the park. Go home, idiot.”
There is a divide down the nation, now. First, the Virtuous Saints, who read the government guidelines like a Bible and live by them, and get really arsey with you when you walk slightly too close to them on the pavement even if the pavement is quite narrow and they are right in the damn middle of it – and who have this sort of divine blind spot to their own presence outside, in the forbidden and unholy places.
Then we have the Sinners, people without gardens who go and lie down in a park on weekends when it’s sunny or think a bike ride (which the government still deems “acceptable”) is acceptable. We all want to do our bit, I understand that. We all have a weird kink for the Keep Calm and Carry On spirit of the NHS in crisis. But I do think we’re about a week away from riots breaking out between Good Outside People and Bad Outside People.
Then A&E departments are going to have to mop all that up, and the whole fracas will unflatten the curve and keep us all inside for an extra six weeks. Piers Morgan is going to do a really pink-in-the-face  Good Morning Britain bit calling them all “traitors” – and I’m going to have to grit my teeth and watch as that goes righteously viral.
Our other new national sport is apparently burning down 5G towers – inspired by what even fact fans must admit is a world-class conspiracy theory, which elegantly blends our fear of disease with our fear of China and our fear of new technology nobody really understands to begin with. As the BBC reports, there have been at least three mast fires in the past week – in Birmingham, Liverpool and Melling – but the graphs tell us there are surely more on the way.
Last week broadcasters were told by Ofcom that they’d face sanctions if they spread baseless 5G theories, after the community radio station Uckfield FM gave airtime to a woman who introduced herself as a “registered nurse” (who you might expect to be in a hospital rather than typing out long Facebook posts about how 5G infected bats in Wuhan with corona), who explained that 5G is somehow sucking the air out of our lungs, along with other stuff that has gained a weird traction on WhatsApp and made people harass fibre-optics engineers in the street. As a precautionary measure I went out to get some tinfoil to wrap around my head but all the shelves had been raided.
There has been speculation that 5G disinformation has connections to Russia, like all the finest disinformation – as the Verge pointed out in a new report on Britain’s world-beating cellular arson industry, the New York Times warned last year that Moscow’s propaganda channels were pushing stories that 5G led to brain cancer, infertility, Alzheimer’s, autism and heart tumours. But even if the stories come from Russia, it still takes British people to believe them before a cell tower gets burned down in Merseyside.
For some reason, destroying forward-thinking technology – which is also particularly useful for, say, staying in touch with people without leaving the house, which in my opinion is a vaguely useful service right now – because you’re worried about it impacting on your health, all while an unseen and real threat actually does impact on people’s health, seems to me a particularly British unreaction to this whole mess. We’re living through history, and we’re living through it abominably. Kids will be learning about this in schools, one day. Think about that next time you politicise sun exposure and set fire to a big lamppost.

Europe’s governments have begun to look ahead to the post-lockdown phase of their battle against Covid-19 as curves on the continent flatten, while the US braces for “peak death week” and Japan prepares to declare a state of national emergency.
Austria on Monday became the first EU country to publicly announce plans to lift its restrictions. “The aim is that from April 14 ... smaller shops up to 400 square metres, as well as hardware and garden stores, can open again, under strict security conditions,” the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said.
If the government’s timetable goes to plan, larger shops could reopen on 1 May and hotels, restaurants and other services from mid-May, Kurz said, adding that “everything will depend” on whether citizens continue to obey draconian distancing rules this week and over the Easter break.
In Germany, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Monday that the coronavirus pandemic was “the EU’s biggest test since its foundation” and thanked Germans for following the government’s instructions. But she added that it was still too early to set a date for lifting the country’s lockdown.
However, as Germany reported its its fourth consecutive daily drop in cases, a leaked interior ministry document revealed a list of measures that officials seemingly believe might allow public life to gradually resume after the end of the country’s lockdown, currently scheduled for 19 April.
The measures include an obligation to wear masks in public, limits on public gatherings, and mechanisms to allow more than 80% of people an infected person has been in contact with to be traced within 24 hours of diagnosis, permitting schools to reopen on a regional basis and strict border controls to be relaxed.
Like several EU countries, Austria and Germany look set to rely on mobile phone apps to trace citizens’ movements and warn them of potential risks of infection, prompting the bloc’s data protection supervisor on Monday to urge the development of a single, more secure pan-European app.

Spain, which has recorded the second highest Covid-19 death toll in the world so far after Italy, also reported a fourth consecutive fall in its daily death tally as well as falls in hospital admissions and critical care cases.
While strict confinement rules introduced on 14 March will remain in force until 26 April, the government announced on Monday that it is planning to widen coronavirus testing to include people without symptoms, as a first step towards slowly easing the lockdown.
“We are preparing ourselves for de-escalation, for which it will be very important to know who is contaminated,” said the foreign minister, Arancha González Laya.
Cases in Italy, Spain and France
Italy on Monday reported 636 deaths, roughly 100 more than the previous day, but its infection rate slowed again, with the number of new positive cases rising by under 2,000, or 2.1%. The health minister, Roberto Speranza, told the daily La Repubblica that the coming period was going to be hard.
“There are difficult months ahead,” he said. “Our task is to create the conditions to live with the virus,” at least until a vaccine arrives.
The daily death toll in France, which went into lockdown later than Spain and Italy, also fell on Sunday, to 357 from 441 in the previous 24 hours. The health ministry said hospital and intensive care admissions were also declining, but warned people it was still essential to continue respecting strict confinement measures.
Deaths in Italy, Spain, France and Germany
According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, the coronavirus has reached more than 210 countries and territories around the world, infecting 1.28 million people and killing more than 70,000. Nearly half of the world’s population is living in some form of lockdown.
Among other developments:
Norway said it considered its outbreak “under control” but cautioned it was too early to say if restrictions could be lifted.
As 51 African countries reported 9,198 cases of Covid-19 and 414 deaths, South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called for unity and a massive aid effort.
The trajectory of infections in Iran appears to have started a “gradual” decline, the government said.
Indonesia recorded its biggest daily jump in cases, with 218 confirmed on Monday, while the Philippines recorded 414 new infections.
Russia also recorded its biggest daily jump with 954 new cases of the disease.
France is facing its deepest recession since the end of the second world war, the finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said.
But if curves are flattening in Europe, elsewhere there was little sign of a let-up. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Monday the government planned to declare a state of emergency and proposed a $1tn stimulus package.

Pressure has increased on the government to take action as Tokyo announced a record 148 new cases on Sunday, followed by 83 more on Monday. Japan is unlikely to introduce a hard lockdown, but the government will aim to exert strong psychological pressure through requests and instructions.
The total number of positive cases in Japan has nearly doubled in the last seven days, with Tokyo the main hub. A rapid spread of the virus is a huge risk in the Japanese capital, a city of nearly 14 million, and Japan has one of world’s oldest populations, with nearly a third of the population – 36 million people – over the age of 65.
In the US, authorities have warned the worst is yet to come. Officials on Monday told the country to prepare for a deadly week as the accelerating US death toll, currently approaching 10,000, closed the gap with Italy’s and Spain’s.

“It’s going to be the peak hospitalisation, peak ICU week and, unfortunately, peak death week,” said Adm Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, raising the alarm in particular alarm for New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Detroit.
The US total of 336,000 confirmed cases is by far the world’s largest and roughly twice as many people a day are dying in the US as in Spain and Italy.
Donald Trump suggested the country was starting to see “light at the end of the tunnel”. But Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Sunday that “doesn’t take away from the fact that tomorrow, the next day, are going to look really bad”.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Monday urged governments to protect women from what he described as a horrifying rise in domestic violence as a consequence of coronavirus measures. “For many women and girls, the threat looms largest where they should be safest: in their own homes,” he said.
Guterres urged all governments to make “the prevention and redress of violence against women a key part of their national response plans for Covid-19”.

When I was a teenager, a strange rumour began to circulate around the small Scottish seaside town where I lived. Roadworks were demolishing the corner of an ancient churchyard, in order to widen the road. The site, long since abandoned, dated back to the 1600s, and contained a picturesque, ivy-clad ruin, open to the sky. It was a place much frequented by tenebrous adolescents like myself. The story was that several of the workmen had come down with a mysterious illness: fever and swellings in the lymph nodes. It was digging up the graves, we told each other, with gothic relish. They got the bubonic plague! It will spread! The whole town is going to die!
It didn’t, of course. The roadworks stalled briefly, a lurid fence around them, but nobody contracted the Black Death. Slightly disappointed, we kept going to school, and life carried on much as before.
Even now, whenever I pass that graveyard, the roofless church still draws my eye. And I think about those deeply buried 17th-century people, packed like tubers into the earth beyond the rebuilt wall. Did they die of the plague? Did the bacterium Yersinia pestis lie dormant in the soil for more than 300 years, only to infect some hapless workmen? Newly curious about contagion and its attendant fears, I call my scientist sister and ask her if she remembers any of this. She does but is quick to discredit it. “The bacterium would have died shortly after the person,” she says. “Digging up graves is never really a risk.”
Truth versus teen hysteria aside, what is clear from this story is that our collective memory of that particular pandemic refuses to fade. The disease variously known as the plague, the Black Death, the pestilence, or the bubonic plague, occupies a potent and febrile space in our minds and in our thinking about infection. The first song you ever learned, for example. What might that have been? It could have been “Row Your Boat” or perhaps “Pat-a-Cake”, but there’s a strong chance it was “Ring a Ring O’ Roses”.
The tune is eerily, maddeningly anodyne, employing the same circling three notes for the initial couplet, the words of which, some believe, are about the most devastating pandemic ever to sweep the globe. The “ring o’ roses” refers to the distinctive red marks on the skin, caused by the disease; carrying a posy of flowers was thought to ward off miasmas. The final lines – “atishoo, atishoo, we all fall down!” – are grimly self-explanatory.

 Ring o’ Roses by Thomas Webster. Photograph: Sepia Times/Universal Images Group via Getty Images
I have strong memories of singing it, with blithe gusto, in the classroom, in the playground, at birthday parties, at Sunday school. With clasped hands, we all formed a circle until the closing words, when the connections were broken and we threw ourselves to the floor, alone and untethered. We had no idea what we were enacting. When I was working as a teacher in Hong Kong in the mid-1990s, this rhyme came up in a textbook. With the zeal of the recently qualified, I taught it to the class, getting them to mimic me as I did the actions. I then explained what it meant, thinking that they might find it interesting. But the classroom fell profoundly silent as 20 or so Hong Kong Chinese students stared at me in dismay. Why, they wanted to know, did British children sing about something as horrible as the plague?
My pupils had a point. The Black Death is no child’s play. The most infamous outbreak originated in China in 1334 and rapidly spread along trade routes, reaching Europe in 1340. It would kill an estimated 25 million people, a third of the world’s population. It continued to raise its hideous head at intervals over the ensuring centuries. London suffered a prolonged outbreak from 1665-66, as documented by both Samuel Pepys and Daniel Defoe, who was a child at the time. More than 70,000 Londoners died during this two-year period; at the epidemic’s height, more than 2,000 plague deaths were recorded in a single week.
When I began to write Hamnet, a novel about Shakespeare’s lost son and his link to the play Hamlet, I knew I would need to grapple with the spectre of the plague. It was an ever present threat for Elizabethans. The shadow of this disease shaped and defined their lives. They would have been all too familiar with its symptoms and signs: the black crosses on the doors, the cries of “Bring out your dead!”, the death carts, the watchmen posted at city gates and outside infected houses, and the chilling sight of plague doctors. These were men in long robes and sinister beaked masks – the cone of which was stuffed with herbs– and armed with long sticks, used to “examine” their patients from a purportedly safe distance.
In the Stratford-upon-Avon parish register for July 1564, three months after the baptism of a certain William Shakespeare, there is an entry of three words: Hic incipit pestis. Here begins plague. In the ensuing six months, just over a tenth of the town died – 237 people, four of whom lived on the same street as the Shakespeare family.
Shakesepare’s working life, as both playwright and actor, was repeatedly disrupted by it. Whenever an outbreak of what was known as “the pestilence” occurred in London, almost the first thing the authorities did was to close the playhouses in an attempt to prevent the spread of infection. So, for long months, Shakespeare and his company were forced to shut up shop and tour their productions in smaller towns, in Kent or Shropshire. Edward Alleyn, while on tour in Bath, wrote the following solicitous instructions to his wife: “Every evening throwe water before your dore … and haue in your windowes good store of rue.”



If the coronavirus teaches us anything it is that nothing is stable, that our situation must be reassessed every day

In order to write Hamnet, I had to put myself inside the skin of a 16th-century mother who realises that a terrible illness has entered her house. Two or three years ago, when I began the novel, this was purely an exercise of the imagination. The concept was so alien to me, then, so out of reach. What might it have felt like, I speculated, as I sat in my ergonomic chair in my centrally heated house, to know that a fatal disease could at any moment be sweeping towards you, from far off continents? How might you react if you thought it had entered your town, your street, your house?
I resorted to research: I examined maps of Elizabethan trade routes; I plotted where spices and perfumes would have been picked up, and where they might have been exchanged for furs or silks or gems; I read up on the lifecycle of the flea, and marvelled that it can live for up to a year. No wonder the disease spread so fast. I used this knowledge to write a chapter that traces the journey of an infected flea from a monkey in Alexandria all the way to a seamstress in Warwickshire.
And now I find myself once more studying maps and infographics of infection. Here again are the red arrows of contagion, sweeping across lands and seas; here are peaked graphs of deaths; here are lists of symptoms; here again are people walking about cities with masks covering their faces. Except this is not the distant past, this is not the Black Death, and this is not for a work of fiction. It is, unthinkably, the here and now. It is us, our neighbours, our children, our parents. Hic incipit pestis.
If this coronavirus crisis teaches us anything it is that nothing is stable, that our situation must be reassessed every day, sometimes every hour. The disease won’t reach us, we are told, and then it does. The schools will not close, we are told, and then they do. The lockdown will not happen, then it does.

 ‘By the time this pandemic has passed, the world will be different. And so will we’ ... Maggie O’Farrell. Photograph: Pako Mera/Alamy Stock Photo
I’ve read that in times of trauma, the brain performs a scan for similar or parallel experiences, the better to inform itself of means of survival. Perhaps, in coping with Covid-19, we are looking to ingrained history lessons about the plague. If disease threatens to invade, these half-remembered practices are telling us, put on a mask. Shut your front door. Keep your loved ones close. Bury your dead quickly and without ceremony. Leave the city, if you can, and if you can’t, stay at home. Above all, keep going. This devastating pandemic of the past has irreversibly shaped our thinking about contagion. The plague, whether we are aware of it or not, is woven into our language, our communication, our very geographies.
Why, for example, do we say “bless you” if someone sneezes – a verbal reflex that crosses all cultures and languages? Because of the Plague, a sneeze being the first sign of an illness that could end a life in 24 hours. Why do we give flowers to sick people? Because of the ancient belief that the proximity of certain plants offers protection from infection. Why are cats traditionally associated with witches? Because when cat populations rose, the cases of the plague dipped and somehow from this arose the skewed logic that cats were consorts of Satan. In his diary, Pepys noted that around 200,000 cats were killed in London, by order of the mayor. It’s not hard to imagine what effect this had on the number of flea-bearing rats. Why do we currently wear masks, like those long-ago, questionably qualified plague doctors? Advice on their effectiveness varies, but still we cling to them, almost as talismans. When conventional medicine fails us, perhaps we too are prone to fall back on superstitions and charms.
The Black Death is responsible for the layouts of our cities, the very streets on which we live. Plague is a decisive town-planner, the endoskeleton of urban life, especially for green spaces. Islington Green, Golden Square, Green Park, Shepherd’s Bush Green, Vincent Square, Christchurch Gardens: all these are reputed London plague burial grounds and have remained undeveloped because of the mass graves beneath. The engineers of Crossrail unearthed some 14th-century plague graves near Charterhouse Square as recently as 2013. You can hear it in the city’s street names, too: Pitfield Street, Vinegar Alley, Pesthouse Close, Holywell Mount.
My children, as yet, have no idea why an area of the Edinburgh park in which they regularly play has intriguing dips and hummocks. Up and down, up and down go the miniature grassy drumlins, said to contain thousands of plague corpses. If you build a snowman in one of the hollows, it will still be there long after all the other snow has melted, almost as if they possess their own sub-zero microclimates.
It would have been unimaginable to the citizens who dug these pits that the sites would in time become leafy grounds of leisure. Equally unthinkable would have been a song about the plague becoming a birthday party favourite, just as we would find it unsavoury to picture future children singing rhymes about the pandemic of 2020. Will games be played about coronavirus, will teenagers frighten each other with tales about it, will museum displays be made of our surgical masks and bottles of hand sanitiser?
Impossible to say, of course. What is certain is that, by the time this pandemic has passed, the world will be different. And so will we. Like the Black Death, Covid-19 makes no distinctions; it shows no mercy; it does not recognise borders, superstitions or, in some cases, treatment; it is the ultimate leveller.
Any person who has come through a severe illness will know that the experience changes you for ever. You emerge from your sickroom as one who has passed through fire, recast, all too aware of both your frailty and your strength. In the same way, a population that goes through a crisis will also be changed, and the coming generations will inherit this sensibility. We will emerge from this but we will be different, depleted, forced to make ourselves anew. We will never be able to go back to a time before this pandemic, to a time of security and confidence, when we thought we were inviolate, immune. We will carry this with us, always; we will never be able to forget.

 The EU can emerge stronger from the pandemic if Merkel seizes the moment ","
“Europe will be forged in crises,” said Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the European Union, “and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.” What kind of Europe emerges from the coronavirus crisis will depend on the answers given to three tests.
First, the Hungarian test: can a dictatorship be a member of the EU? Even before this year, Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party had so far eroded democracy in Hungary that the country would not qualify for admission to the EU if it were a candidate for membership. He has now used the coronavirus pandemic as justification to take sweeping emergency powers, allowing him to rule by decree for an unlimited period. Hungary is – for the duration of these powers – a dictatorship. Monnet also said a dictatorship cannot be a member of the European Community (which subsequently became the EU). Today, one is.
The sanctions available to EU institutions are slow and complex, but there is one organisation that can and should act decisively now: the European People’s party (EPP), the hugely influential centre-right grouping to which Fidesz still effectively belongs. (Although the party is notionally suspended, Fidesz MEPs still operate as part of the EPP group in the European parliament.) The EPP should have kicked Fidesz out long ago. Instead, it has pursued a policy of appeasement. If it does not expel the Hungarian dictator’s party now, it will lose any last shreds of credibility. When EPP politicians make fine speeches about democracy, the rule of law and European values, young Europeans will be more than justified in shouting: you utter hypocrites!
Next, the Italian test. Is there solidarity in the heart of Europe? Will the eurozone enable its hardest-hit member states to recover? Last month we watched with horror as one of the most highly developed parts of our continent, with one of the best health services, was overwhelmed by the pandemic. When Italy emerges from this Gehenna, it will face a huge challenge of economic recovery, handicapped by the fact it already has one of the eurozone’s heaviest burdens of national debt. Its ability to borrow the large sums needed will depend on the credibility of mutual support inside the eurozone.
Even before the pandemic, Italy had gone from being one of the most Europhile countries in the EU to one of the most Eurosceptic. The crisis has exacerbated these feelings. In one poll conducted early last month, 88% of Italians said they felt that Europe was not supporting Italy, and a staggering 67% said they saw EU membership as a disadvantage. There is a European Union without Britain. There is no European Union without Italy.
And finally, there is the test facing Germany: can it save the day? Will Europe’s central power finally face up to the logic of a monetary union from which it has very significantly benefitted? Germany has produced the most impressive national response to the pandemic of any democracy outside Asia. Its provision of large-scale testing, ventilators and critical care beds shows the advantages of having both good public services and a strong medical industry. Angela Merkel gave an outstanding television address to the nation – a lecture on democracy, solidarity and individual responsibility, delivered with the brain of a scientist and the heart of a pastor’s daughter. Only one thing was missing. The word “Europe” was not mentioned.
In the meantime, Germany has shown solidarity with its hard-pressed European neighbours, sending consignments of face masks to Lombardy and transporting critically ill Italian and French patients to German hospitals. But it is in responding to the economic and political crisis that German leadership is really called for.
Germany can help Europe pass the Hungarian test, not least because Merkel’s Christian Democrats are the most powerful party in the EPP. Now they must surely come out for the expulsion of Fidesz. All the candidates to succeed Merkel as leader of the Christian Democrats should be asked where they stand on this.
It is in meeting the Italian test, however, that Germany’s contribution will be decisive. As one recent headline put it, Italy’s future is in German hands. If the eurozone – and therefore Europe – is to recover economic health, the Italian government and other southern European governments must be able to borrow money using the financial credibility of Germany and other northern European states. In the dry jargon, there would be “debt mutualisation”. Next to Italy, Spain has been hardest hit by the crisis. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has talked of the need for Europe to build a “wartime economy” and appealed for a new intra-European Marshall plan.
Seven leading German economists have cogently argued that this recovery plan should include the issuance of €1tn of community bonds, jointly guaranteed by all eurozone governments. Unlike the eurobonds discussed after the financial crisis, this would be new money, dedicated to addressing the results of a disaster for which no southern European government could possibly be held responsible. To ask how precisely this support is best given would take us into the acronymic weeds of ECB, EIB, ESM and even EFSM (don’t ask). But the basic question is simple: having cast aside its own fiscal taboos (“debt brake”, “black zero”) to help itself out, to the tune of what may well turn out to be close to €1tn, is Germany prepared to do a fraction of that to help other countries in the same boat? In the case of a monetary union, “the same boat” is not just a loose metaphor. Whatever package European leaders agree upon this week, it must be big, and be seen to be big.
Germany’s leading tabloid, Bild, recently published an open letter to Italy headed “We are with you!” It praised Italy for having brought “good food” to Germany and concluded: “Ciao, Italia. We’ll see you again shortly. Here’s to an espresso, a vino rosso, whether on holiday or in the pizzeria.” An interesting idea of solidarity. A few days earlier, the same paper published an article headlined “What will become of the euro? Debt mutualisation is threatened.” Dear Bild reader, what Italy needs is not your custom over a holiday espresso in Tuscany, charming though that would doubtless be, but the mutualisation of debt, as a necessary consequence of a European monetary union from which you, dear Bild reader, have benefitted greatly.
There is one person in Europe who can both take and defend the necessary actions: Chancellor Merkel. Last year, I argued that Germany needed a change of government, because the grand coalition was exhausted and was strengthening the political extremes in opposition to it. That is out of the question now, in the middle of a force-10 storm. Instead, Merkel has an unexpected last chance to go down in history as a major architect of a stronger European Union. Bismarck said a politician’s task is to hear God’s footsteps advancing through history, and then jump to hang on to his coattails. That coat is passing now.

On Wednesday, Three Rivers, a small hospital in rural Washington, had exactly nine days left before it would run out of money to pay its staff and be forced to close. That same day, its CEO learned the hospital likely had its first coronavirus patient.
The coronavirus pandemic has put a strain even on the wealthier parts of America’s vast, fragmented healthcare system: there are not enough beds, not enough ventilators, not enough protective equipment. But in rural communities, the stakes are different: not whether there will be enough beds at the local hospital, but whether the local hospital will be able to stay open at all.
Like many American families, rural hospitals in the United States have been operating paycheck to paycheck for years, never making enough money to save up for an emergency. Now, the pandemic is threatening the survival of many rural hospitals, which would leave communities particularly vulnerable to the impact of the virus with fewer hospital beds and fewer options.
‘What little cash we had evaporated’
At least three rural hospitals have already announced abrupt closures in recent weeks, including one in Wellington, Kansas, and two in West Virginia, leaving local residents and healthcare providers scrambling to make new plans for the pandemic.
Three Rivers hospital, in a remote area of Washington state near the border with Canada, has been at the frontlines of the crisis.
The hospital serves about 15,000 people scattered over 2,500 sq miles (about 6,400 sq km), according to hospital CEO Scott Graham. Its surrounding  towns are tiny: one or two grocery stores, one gas station. “We think of it as more frontier than rural,” Graham said.
Three Rivers hospital had scraped by for years with a smaller-than-optimal staff and careful economizing, he said. Then, Washington became the first state with a confirmed case of coronavirus, and a confirmed coronavirus death.
Once social distancing guidelines were put in place, including guidelines to stop elective surgeries, “our source of revenue basically stopped”, Graham said. Patients who would typically visit the hospital for non-coronavirus related health issues now seemed reluctant to come in. The volume of emergency room visits dropped. So did primary care. “What little cash we had evaporated,” Graham said.
By late March, Graham, who had been the hospital’s CEO for six years, was starting to plan for something he had never done before: shutting down a hospital that no longer had enough money to function.

On 20 March, the state’s hospital association wrote governor Jay Inslee, warning that five rural hospitals, including Three Rivers, were “facing imminent closure”.
The response from Washington state officials was swift, Graham said. Within hours of raising his concerns, he was on the phone with Sue Birch, a former nurse who had spent decades living in rural Colorado and now runs Washington state’s healthcare authority.
Birch said she promised Graham that they’d find a way to get the hospital through the crisis.
“We can talk about closures later,” she recalled telling him. “Right now, I need you holding my front line.”
A catastrophic blow
Losing a hospital is a serious blow to rural communities, whose residents are disproportionately older, and often struggle with existing health conditions. While Three Rivers does not have an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), it’s a place to go for immediate care, for health problems small and large, that’s not an hour or more away. 
A hospital closure also has a huge economic toll, since in towns with “a school and a Walmart and a church and a post office”, as Birch put it, a small local hospital may be one of the major local employers. And it has ripple effects far beyond the rural areas the hospital directly serves.
“We have to remind ourselves that we are all in this together,” Birch said. Rural areas “are where our food is produced. We urban areas need them, and they need us.”
Amid the coronavirus pandemic, rural hospitals play a critical role.
As urban hospitals brace for a wave of seriously ill coronavirus patients, Three Rivers has been planning to use its beds to take in the overflow of other patients from those larger hospitals, helping the state hospital system as a whole stay afloat, Graham said.
While Three Rivers could provide about one or two patients with ventilators, Graham said, it does not have a formal ICU, or staff trained to work with ICU patients. But it will help take in and stabilize more seriously ill coronavirus patients before sending them to a larger hospital, with more advanced equipment, about an hour away.
It can only do any of these things if its own doors stay open.

A lifeline
The first financial lifeline for Three Rivers came from Washington state, which sent an emergency $2m out to a small group of struggling rural hospitals in March. Three Rivers got about $200,000.
But keeping the hospital running costs roughly $1m a month, Graham said, with payroll for staff alone costing at least $700,000 a month. The emergency funds from the state, although helpful, only pushed the hospital’s money crisis back about two weeks.
As he was trying to secure protective gear for hospital staff and prepare for an incoming surge of coronavirus patients, Graham also made desperate calls to lawmakers and journalists, trying to secure enough cash to make it through the hospital’s next pay day.
Meanwhile, Birch, the state healthcare administrator, tried to work with federal healthcare authorities to open up more emergency money for rural hospitals in her state, and in others.
The federal government’s lifeline for struggling hospitals, announced 27 March, would send Three Rivers and other financially vulnerable hospitals an advance of three months of their typical payments for Medicare, the federally funded health insurance program for senior citizens.
That advance funding would allow the hospital to pay its staff at least through the spring and summer, until about early August. By then, Graham hopes, the virus will be more under control, and more normal hospital care, and the income from patients getting that care, will resume.
Three Rivers submitted the paperwork for the Medicare advance on Wednesday, Graham said. Federal authorities told hospitals that they anticipated they could send out the payments within seven days.
The next day payroll for the hospitals’ roughly 100 employees is Friday. If the payment comes as quickly as promised, he said, “We’ll be okay.”
‘The death knell’
Still, Graham worries about the consequences of even a brief bureaucratic delay.
That’s a fear shared by rural health experts, said George Pink, the deputy director of North Carolina Rural Health Research program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
“If a hospital misses payroll once, that can be the death knell,” Pink said. “You’re telling the community and the vendors and the staff that you’re on the ropes.”
At least 128 rural hospitals have shut down in the past decade alone, according to data assembled by the rural health research program.
There may be more substantial federal help on the way for rural hospitals at the brink of closure. Congress’s $2.2tn emergency relief bill includes $100bn for hospitals. But how that money will be distributed and, again, how fast it will go out, is still not clear on the ground.
“The details have been really, really sparse,” Graham said.
Birch said she is optimistic that the safety net for rural hospitals will hold through the pandemic. Emergency payments from the federal government should come reliably within seven days, if hospitals apply for them, she said.
As of Friday night, Three Rivers still had not received the Covid-19 testing results for the first patient who had been showing symptoms that had initially seemed consistent with coronavirus. Test results, like emergency funding, were still coming very slowly, when they came at all.
But one thing was clear: the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across the rural county was rising. On Wednesday, it had just been three, Graham said. On Friday, it was six.

Ministers have been accused of focusing on saving their careers instead of the lives of coronavirus victims by authorising “cowardly and shameful” anonymous briefings against some of the UK’s most senior public officials.
Smears by unnamed Downing Street sources against Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, and Public Health England (PHE) executives show that “some within government are still putting self-preservation first”, according to the head of the senior civil servants’ union.
It comes amid concern across Whitehall that cabinet ministers and their special advisers are mounting a concerted effort to pass the blame for the UK’s faltering response to the pandemic on to officials.
Government sources were quoted this weekend claiming that Sedwill had failed to get a grip of government, PHE officials had not placed enough emphasis on testing and NHS England officials had failed to control personal protective equipment (PPE) supply.
In an article for the Guardian, Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, which represents the UK’s most senior public servants, said some in government were ignoring the dedication of public servants and instead using them as scapegoats.
“As pressure mounts over the capacity for coronavirus testing and the supply of PPE and ventilators, finding someone to blame rather than fixing the problem seems to be the priority for some at the heart of government,” said Penman. “Well-placed anonymous sources have started pointing fingers at everyone from the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to Public Health England.
“If mistakes have been made, ministers and civil servants will rightly be held accountable … While ministers and officials must be scrutinised for their decisions as events unfold, many of these questions will inevitably be for another day.
“Right now, we need ministers and their advisers focusing on saving lives, not their careers. While public servants across the UK are working night and day – literally putting their lives on the line for the country – some within government are still putting self-preservation first. It is not only cowardly and shameful, it’s also destructive.”
A Times article on Saturday quoted an ally of Johnson saying that Sedwill was under scrutiny for failing to control government departments. “He’s more present now but there is a bit of a mystery about where he was in the early days of all this,” the source was quoted as saying.
The same article claimed that ministers were blaming PHE officials for an inflexible attitude and insensitivity to public pressure for answers. “What this has exposed is these people’s utter lack of accountability,” a senior official told the newspaper. “It’s not just PHE, it’s a whole world of these bodies that bumble along, occasionally banning Coco Pops or something but for the most part entirely out of sight.”
In a following article, a “senior figure” told the Sunday Times that NHS England was being blamed by ministers for failing to get a grip on PPE supply.
Civil servants have also been angered this weekend by claims that the prime minister is “extremely unlikely” to sack the home secretary, Priti Patel, even if she is found to have bullied civil servants across three separate government departments.

The Cabinet Office investigation was launched last month after claims from civil servants and the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam, the Home Office’s most senior official.
Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministers’ interests, is expected to pass on the findings within days.
He will decide whether Patel broke rules. However, the final say rests with Johnson, who can overrule Allan.
Rutnam, who resigned after anonymous briefings against him in the media, is suing the government for constructive dismissal after accusing Patel of “swearing and belittling people”.
As well as witnessing Patel’s alleged bullying behaviour, Rutnam claimed he was briefed against across the media by sources said to be from either No 10 or friends or allies of Patel. He was accused of being unable to do his job and of being undeserving of his pension, and was compared to the Winnie the Pooh character Eeyore.
Patel has denied the claims.
One Whitehall source said: “If Patel is cleared without a thorough inquiry into the many claims of bullying, it will be seen as a whitewash and will heighten mistrust across government.”

Prime ministers do not aspire to infallibility or immortality, but a display of mental or physical frailty at a point of national crisis is something any Downing Street spin doctor would dearly wish to avoid, and if possible suppress.
The impression of the ship of state adrift, and the helmsman heading below deck, pleading illness, hardly inspires confidence, however much personal sympathy in this case is felt towards Boris Johnson. With questions being asked about the government’s lockdown exit strategy and Labour revitalised by a new leader seeking to make a mark, No 10 needs to be at its most coherent and decisive.
It is also a concern if Johnson as adjudicator is absent just as Whitehall jostling starts between those putting either the interests of the nation’s health or its economy first.
But the infectiousness of this virus made it practically impossible for Johnson to hide from others in No 10, and the public, that he had contracted it. Once the decision was made for Johnson to go to hospital, No 10 went public within two hours. Little other option was available. Rumours had been circulating for days that his recovery was not under way, highlighted by the return of the health secretary, Matt Hancock.
Quick guide What are coronavirus symptoms and should I go to a doctor?  
 Show

What is Covid-19?

It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.



What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?

According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.
About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.
In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:
a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly
As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.



Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?

Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.
In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.



How many people have been affected?

China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
There have been over 69,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.
More than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.




Was this helpful?







Thank you for your feedback.

One person closely involved said: “The difficulty is that the crisis is so all-enveloping, the PM could not stop working. No one likes to think they are dispensable. The first step was to get him to admit to himself how ill he was becoming. What was subsequently admitted to the nation was a second order issue”.
Even now No 10 is reluctant to go into detail on the prime minister’s health, stressing in its statement that the hospital admission was simply a precautionary step to undertake tests, rather than an acknowledgement that he had deteriorated. He would continue to be briefed at his hospital bed and was very much in charge.

 Boris Johnson says he still has 'minor symptoms' of the coronavirus – video
By contrast, Donald Trump in opening his Sunday press conference provided a dramatic, possibly melodramatic, medical bulletin on Johnson’s health, offering the US’s prayers to help Johnson in “his personal fight with the virus”. Trump has a relationship with the truth that could be described as sometimes adjacent, but he did not give the impression that Johnson was going to hospital for routine tests.
If No 10 is being economical about a more serious illness, it would not be the first time the public has been misled by a serving prime minister about his health. The UK may be at war with an invisible virus, but British prime ministers at times of conflict have always been reluctant to admit they have been incapacitated. David Lloyd George in 1918 suffered a bout of influenza so severe his valet said it was touch and go whether he would survive. Medical bulletins at the time made no suggestion he was in any danger.
Andrew Bonar Law resigned in 1923 only on receiving a diagnosis of terminal throat cancer, and Henry Campbell-Bannerman, prime minister from 1905 to 1908, died days after his resignation in 10 Downing Street.
During Winston Churchill’s two wartime illnesses, the full extent of them was never revealed. In February 1943, after the then 69-year-old contracted pneumonia, his personal physician Charles Wilson drafted a bulletin, but Churchill immediately demanded to see it. He dismissed it as “alarmist” and liable to cause confusion and despondency and was, in any case, untrue.
Churchill, therefore, dictated his own bulletin, but Wilson said it was inaccurate and misleading and he could not possibly sign it. Elaborate textual negotiations led to a compromise, and subsequent bulletins always referred to his improving condition.
A further bout of pneumonia in August 1944 was not publicised at all, and according to his wife, Clementine, only the smallest circle was informed.
Similarly, the cocktail of drugs being taken by Anthony Eden during the Suez crisis was known only to a few, and even now the impact on his judgment is a matter of dispute.
But these were more discreet times, and the ruling class could form a small circle of trust. That in turn made it easier to put out bland medical bulletins that disguised more than they revealed.
The White House has been equally skilled at suppressing the truth about its president’s health. Franklin D Roosevelt famously had polio, Dwight D Eisenhower had both a heart attack and a stroke while in office. John F Kennedy suffered Addison’s disease, hypothyroidism and severe back pain, none of which was publicly disclosed during his lifetime. Grover Cleveland in 1893 even had a secret operation to remove a cancerous growth that took place on a boat, dressed up as a fishing trip on a lake.
The fear that power, credibility and respect will seep away if ill health is revealed remains. Not just the electorate will lose faith, but your cabinet colleagues may sniff a succession. Tony Blair was reluctant to reveal his heart issues for fear allies of the the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, might take advantage.
Hillary Clinton was hammered when she contracted pneumonia, and wobbled in front of the TV cameras when walking to a car. In 2016 news of her illness received 13 times more coverage than revelations about fraud in Trump’s charitable foundation. Bernie Sanders has frantically denied his heart attack makes him the weaker of the three septuagenarians seeking the presidency.
But outright suppression of the truth in modern politics has its downsides. Figures such as Peter Mandelson, Gordon Brown’s chief communicator after the financial crash, have warned the prerequisite for national unity at a time of genuine crisis is a government that levels with the British public about the difficulties the Whitehall machine is facing. 
There will come a point when, if Johnson’s condition is serious, the medical and spin doctors will have to tell the public as much.

"68","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/06/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims","2020-04-06T10:08:24-0400","  At least 20 UK phone masts vandalised over false 5G coronavirus claims ","
At least 20 mobile phone masts across the UK are believed to have been torched or otherwise vandalised since Thursday, according to government and industry sources who are increasingly concerned about the impact of baseless theories linking coronavirus to 5G networks.
There have been noticeable clusters of attacks on masts around Liverpool and the West Midlands. Owing to the slow rollout of 5G in the UK, many of the masts that have been vandalised did not contain the technology and the attacks merely damaged 3G and 4G equipment.
There is hope that the rate of attacks may now be slowing. Network operators are particularly concerned about the safety of their staff, as members of the public have confronted telecoms engineers maintaining critical infrastructure, sometimes filming the encounters to share on social media. Mobile operators and home broadband providers estimate there have been at least 30 such incidents in the last week.

Engineers for O2 have been issued with signs to display in their vans while working. The signs, which read “Key worker, keeping your network running”, are intended to spread the message that communications workers are playing a crucial role during the current crisis.
Social networks will meet the government in the coming days to explain what they can do to stop the spread of baseless claims about 5G, although there is a limited amount that can be done to stop videos and messages spreading on messaging services such as WhatsApp.
Despite repeated assurances from international radiation watchdogs that 5G is safe, baseless theories about its purported risks have long bubbled away at the fringes of the internet – in common with previous generations of the telecoms technology. However, the rapid explosion over the last week of claims linking the new telephone standard to the pandemic – fanned by some celebrities and influencers – has caught the industry and the government off guard.
While many long-running Facebook groups have opposed the rollout of 5G technology, in the last week the social network has had to delete multiple pages encouraging vandalism of the phone network. The number of attacks rose rapidly following a suspected arson attack on a mast in Birmingham on Thursday night. Vodafone confirmed that six sites were targeted over the weekend, and other networks suggested they had seen similar numbers.

MobileUK, the industry group that unites the UK’s four main mobile networks, published an open letter to customers asking for help to stop the vandalism.
“We have experienced cases of vandals setting fire to mobile masts, disrupting critical infrastructure and spreading false information suggesting a connection between 5G and the Covid-19 pandemic,” the open letter says. “There is no scientific evidence of any link between 5G and coronavirus. Fact.
“Please help us to make this stop. If you witness abuse of our key workers please report it. If you see misinformation, please call it out. Your help will make a real difference.”

 Why are some in government wasting time briefing against the civil service? ","
As the government struggles to get a grip on the most significant public health emergency in a century, institutions and occupations previously subjected to acrimony, neglect or simple disregard have in the space of a few short weeks become the nation’s saviours. From the BBC to bin collectors, shop workers to care home staff: all have suddenly been recognised as vital and appreciated by public and politicians alike.
However, as pressure mounts over the capacity for coronavirus testing and the supply of personal protective equipment and ventilators, finding someone to blame rather than fixing the problem seems to be the priority for some at the heart of government. Well-placed anonymous sources have started pointing fingers at everyone from the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to Public Health England.
They “bumble along, occasionally banning Coco Pops or something, but for the most part entirely out of sight” is how one source from within government described some of the most senior public health professionals in the country. Elsewhere, an unnamed minister has been happy to lay the blame for the lack of testing at the door of Public Health England, while a “senior figure” was busy pointing the finger at NHS England for a “system” that had given “incorrect” and “overly optimistic” information to ministers. Imagine being on the frontline of planning for a pandemic, knowing the consequences of the decisions you’re making while potentially risking your own health, then seeing that this is what some within government think of your work.
For four short weeks, the briefing war against the civil service that had characterised the government before coronavirus had abated. Witnessing the incredible response of the service, I had hoped that this government would not return to some of the bad old ways. From the job retention scheme, repatriating travellers abroad and processing an extra million universal credit claimants, to those trying to understand and plan for the consequences of this virus: this list is endless, and mostly unseen.
The service itself has also had to completely reorganise, with hundreds of thousands of staff working remotely and in different ways to keep vital public services functioning. Many are also on the frontline, because some public services simply cannot be delivered remotely, and we’re witnessing the first tragic consequences of that necessity.

If mistakes have been made, ministers and civil servants will rightly be held accountable. Every government in the world has been overwhelmed by this virus and will have made major mistakes – some avoidable, some not. While ministers and officials must be scrutinised for their decisions as events unfold, many of these questions will inevitably be for another day.
Right now, we need ministers and their advisers focusing on saving lives, not their careers.

 With Boris Johnson in hospital, government is adrift ","
Boris Johnson is ill and in hospital. That must be wretched for him and his family. We can only wish him well and a speedy recovery. His infection by Covid-19 indicates the extraordinary contagiousness of this disease and possibly its widespread prevalence. Of the first there is now no doubt. Of the second, without testing, there is no clue.
That a prime minister is ill is a serious matter. Yesterday the Queen performed her duty as the nation’s figurehead with remarkable assurance. In clear, undramatic language, she spoke free of cliche and with sincerity. Her few words of hope shone through the darkening forest of the media coverage of these events. It was the first time I smiled at the television in a month.
A prime minister too is a figurehead, but has a harder task. Johnson is the nation’s elected leader at a time of crisis, with millions reliant on his decisiveness, judgment and public demeanour. At least one cabinet minister maintains that these qualities can be deployed from his hospital bed. Sometime soon, that idea will become absurd. It presents the government machine as a driverless car which, in the style of Yes Minister, will perform equally well, if not better, with no politician at the wheel. Leave the experts and “the science” to get on with it, and all will be well.



UK coronavirus live: Boris Johnson remains in hospital 'for observation' after 'comfortable night'

Rumours abound that since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, this machine has been ramshackle. The nation’s health services, so proudly championed for so long, were unprepared both centrally and locally. This was despite trial runs and forewarning. It does not matter who was to blame. The system malfunctioned. Then in mid-stream the cabinet reversed its policy from mitigation to suppression. Ministers ran in and out of Downing Street press conferences, making pledges, setting targets and micro-managing social distancing. Little of what they said carried full conviction.
Suddenly, leadership mattered. Who was in charge? Johnson’s initial glib Churchill imitations (the Queen wisely chose Vera Lynn) had to change, and they did. As Johnson fell ill, news conferences were conducted by the dull, steady Dominic Raab or the flashy, impetuous Matt Hancock. Experts came and went, spurring debate as to what side they were on.
Government lurched into lecture mode. It began telling people not to work, how to shop, and where and with whom to walk. These are not the normal actions of government in a free society. They are painful and massively intrusive on daily life. They are also being taken by ministers and officials amid extremes of risk and uncertainty. The instinct under pressure was not to welcome argument or accountability. It was to demand obedience.
That is not enough. At the very least the use of such powers requires the most explicit public leadership. Bluntly, they need the qualities of communication for which Johnson was supposedly elected. They also need ready scrutiny and challenge, which is currently being supplied only by the media. Parliament has abandoned what should be its primary role: holding executive decision to account. The new Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, was therefore right to refuse Johnson automatic support.
The cabinet cannot operate with half its members in varying degrees of isolation. The wonders of Skype and Zoom cannot replicate the cut and thrust, the body language, the public and private exchanges of a truly deliberative forum. There has to be a conductor knowing when and how to bring the instruments of government into play. There has to be a boss.
Past experience of sick leaders is not happy. Churchill’s doctor, Lord Moran, and his wartime aide, Lord Alanbrooke, related the impact his clinical depressions had on war cabinet morale. The same message came through the 2008 study of sickness in power by the former foreign secretary, David Owen. He traced the hubristic impact that power can have on those who wield it, not least a refusal to believe they might be ill.
Democracies vote for leaders, not anarchists. Every leader’s style is different. Attlee could hardly have been less like Churchill, Heath less like Thatcher, Brown less like Blair. All depended on their close relations in Downing Street with advisers and cabinet colleagues – and suffered when these broke down. Johnson decided from the start that he would not harbour critics in Downing Street, preferring the second rate to the second thought. He made his own indispensability a feature of his rule. In normal times, that is unwise. In a crisis it is stupid.
Britain’s present predicament is yielding lessons aplenty. One is that the formal machinery of government matters. Johnson’s response to coronavirus has been to nationalise, standardise, command and control everything. In his lockdown, one rule must fit all. Such is Britain’s centralist constitution. But if so, it must depend on one thing: efficient and accountable leadership. At present the prime minister is clearly unfit. A public and functioning alternative must surely be in place.

Holly Rasmussen is not one to pay much attention to the detail of politics, and certainly not to sit through presidential press conferences. After all, she has a business to run. Or used to.
But in recent days, Rasmussen, who lives in northern Iowa, has been drawn to Donald Trump’s widely scorned daily television briefings, and she likes what she sees.
“I think he is staying extremely optimistic and I think that’s what a lot of us need,” she said. “I think he’s leading. And this is an unprecedented time to do the best he can without having more people die and the economy completely tank.”
Rasmussen is one of those voters who swung from Barack Obama to Trump and then stuck with the president because she reckoned he was doing a good job with the economy. Now, as coronavirus destroys lives, jobs and businesses – and threatens to drive Rasmussen’s cosmetology school to the wall – she is among those Americans who have bumped up the president’s approval ratings even as he faces a barrage of scorn over his handling of the pandemic.
The latest Gallup poll gave Trump the highest approval numbers of his presidency, bolstered by swing voters, independents and even some Democrats.
The poll is no more than a snapshot in a rapidly evolving crisis, and opinions may change radically in the coming weeks as the death toll rises and the loss of jobs bites deep.

In addition, Rasmussen lives in the small city of Cresco close to Iowa’s northern border with Minnesota. Like much of the midwest, it has yet to be badly hit by the virus and attitudes to the president’s handling of the crisis may shift against him when it is.
But for now, towns and cities across the region are watching the approach of coronavirus with fearful resignation, and many there are prepared to give Trump the benefit of the doubt for now.
In southern Missouri, Cindy Anderson – doing her job in the payroll department of a mental health counselling service from home – worries that when the virus finally hits, small cities like Kennet will be woefully unprepared not least because its only hospital closed a few months ago.
“I think we’ve been forgotten about in a little part of the world because we’re rural. Unfortunately, the area in which we live, there is a lot of poverty and a lot of sick people. When it hits, I’m sure that it will be devastating,” she said.
For all that, Anderson thinks Trump is making the best of a bad situation even if he has made mistakes. “I don’t know if he’s got it right, but I think he’s trying. I think he’s effective,” she said.
But the 65-year-old is frustrated at what she regards as politicised attacks on Trump over his actions, or lack of them, early on in the crisis when she says the focus should be on how to get through this.
“I think that a lot of the news media, they don’t tell the whole story. They tell the piece that sounds the most damning and they don’t add the other piece,” she said.
That’s a view shared by Rasmussen.
“I would rather have just the issues of what’s going on with the coronavirus and what they are doing to help us then just nit picking stuff that I was seeing,” she said.
Rasmussen is critical of the scorn poured on the president when he hesitated to call for businesses to close because of the economic impact. She said his concerns about the financial consequences were legitimate.

The shut down required Rasmussen to close her cosmetology school, leaving her workers without pay and her school facing bankruptcy if the shutdown lasts more than another two months. She agrees that it was necessary to order non-essential businesses to close but as someone who supports the president principally because she thinks he is good for the economy, she is judging him in good part over how he handles a crisis potentially much more severe than the Great Recession of a decade ago.



The missing six weeks: how Trump failed the biggest test of his life

From that perspective, Rasmussen sees a president who, alongside Congress, has been decisive in trying to help ordinary Americans and businesses. Some in the midwest contrast the $2.2tn rescue package, which includes payments to taxpayers, with Obama’s response to the financial crisis by rescuing the banks but not ordinary people losing their homes to foreclosure.
“I was actually shocked when I first started hearing about the (rescue) plan. I thought this is unprecedented. I can’t believe Republicans actually are going for that at all,” she said. “Like, wow, I am completely shocked on that. I really am.”
To Rasmussen that looks like leadership. She regards Trump’s much derided claim that distancing strategies could begin to be lifted by Easter as aspirational.
“It’s him trying to stay optimistic, I thought that was good. It’s hopeful for people. He was trying to put an end time to this which I didn’t think was the worst thing in the world. And he he took a pretty hard hit for a lot of that,” she said.
That’s not how it’s seen by some of those confronting the pandemic.
‘He has blatantly played down the crisis’
Ashly Moore works as an occupational therapist at a hospital in Des Moines, Iowa. She is still seeing patients at some risk to herself because only those showing symptoms are tested for coronavirus.
“It is worrying but there’s not a whole lot you can do about it. And I’m happy to have a job. A lot of people right now are experiencing layoffs and uncertainty. You just take all the precautions that you can,” she said.

Moore said she understands that the pandemic has evolved fast but she does not see leadership from the White House from a president who previously described the growing coronavirus threat as a hoax and then gave himself full marks for handling the crisis. “I tried to be patient and have understanding that to be a president or to be in any kind of position during this type of a crisis is terrifying. You’re criticised no matter what you do. But he has blatantly downplayed the seriousness of this,’ she said.
“He’s obviously concerned about the optics. He’s concerned about his re-election. But if you truly care about leading a nation in a time of crisis, your own re-election really shouldn’t be on your radar. It’s very selfish and egocentric to make that a priority right now.”
Rasmussen though is not alone in the rural midwest in seeing the president’s shifting position as a reflection of her own uncertainty. At first, the numbers of deaths from coronavirus, compared them to lives claimed by flu, opioid overdoses and car crashes did not look startling, and some wondered if the threat was far away and overblown. Rasmussen came to accept the scale of the crisis as she listened to friends and relatives working in health care in bigger cities.
“I myself was thinking, coming from a small community, you don’t see this. But I do have a lot of people in bigger cities that are in health care and hearing some of their stories about not having proper PPE and masks and things, then it started getting a little bit closer to home,” she said.

Leïla Slimani and Marie Darrieussecq may be two of France’s most acclaimed writers – but their accounts of life in lockdown in their second homes in the countryside have unleashed an outpouring of resentment among French readers, with one fellow writer even comparing Slimani to Marie Antoinette.
Slimani, who won the Prix Goncourt for her bestselling novel Lullaby, wrote in Le Monde of how she had left Paris and sequestered herself and her children in their countryside second home since 13 March, telling them that it was “a bit like Sleeping Beauty”. “Tonight, I couldn’t sleep,” she wrote. “Through my bedroom window, I watched dawn break over the hills. The icy grass, the lime trees on the branches of which the first buds appear.”
Darrieussecq, meanwhile, wrote in Le Point of how she hid her car with Paris number plates in the garage after arriving at her second home, using the older car that she keeps there to get around because “I feel it’s not good to drive around with a 75 on our behind”.
“Two hinds graze in our fallow garden,” she continues. “We go to see the sea. It beats, heavy, strong, indifferent. The beach is deserted. I have a vision of a planet without humans.”
As rural France turns its back on Parisians fleeing to the countryside, accusing them of spreading coronavirus, and while police checkpoints are set up to prevent city-dwellers from leaving to go to second homes during the Easter holidays, Slimani and Darrieussecq’s pieces received a less than warm reception from readers and fellow writers.
“Hey poor people,” tweeted the journalist Nicolas Quenel. “Is all well in your 15m apartment for three? To pass the time and take off the pressure of confinement, you can always read the journal of a writer in her family home in the countryside.”
In Brain, Félix Lemaître wrote that contemplating the horizon, as Slimani does in her piece, is a “class privilege”, and that the author’s photos of her country idyll have “a little taste of porn, of obscenity, for all those whose vision for the next few weeks will boil down to an inner courtyard or the building opposite”.
The Lullaby author’s experience of confinement in her half-timbered house in the countryside is “in a parallel universe dreamed up by the Grimm brothers”, wrote author Diane Ducret in Marianne.
“At the very least, we are not having the same experience. If for Leïla Slimani, confinement is like a fairytale, for me it is more like a picaresque novel. I am the picaro, of low social rank, without honour or marginal, yearning for freedom and hoping to survive by being resourceful,” wrote Ducret, adding that “Marie-Antoinette playing farmer in Trianon [in Versailles] could not have been further from the fear, the anguish of the people”.
“Our intellectual elites sometimes seem to me ungrounded, as if the French revolution did not take place in all areas, and that only a certain social class was authorised to express the taste of the time,” Ducret wrote.
“From my window, you can’t see the sky. The building opposite is dirty, the empty streets fill me with roaring anxieties. Being stripped by a virus in my 30s, dying alone, perhaps, in a two-room apartment, tempts me only moderately. It would have been less of a seller than the golden hills and camellias of Leïla Slimani, but it would have been more representative of what we are experiencing.”

Cake has taken on a new significance now that most of us are stuck at home all day, every day. We’re comfort-eating and baking like there’s no tomorrow. But what do you do when you fancy a sponge, but can’t find eggs or your oven is broken and no one will fix it? Here are some recipes to get you through every ingredient shortfall.
If we suggest you replace one missing ingredient with another that you don’t have, or that you would normally never dream of buying, bear in mind that no two kitchen cupboards are the same and you may find that grocers can still supply “fancy” alternatives such as ricotta or flaxseeds while the staples are but a memory.
No self-raising flour
You can make any cake that calls for self-raising flour without it. Nigella Lawson doesn’t even bother keeping any, as she explained a few years back. As long as you know the ratio (2 tsp baking powder to 150g plain flour), it’s easy to make some. There are a lot of decent bakes that include this process in the method, from Dan Lepard’s sour cream butter cake (billed as the easiest cake in the world) to Claire Ptak’s picture-perfect raspberry vanilla sandwich.
No baking powder
Baking powder isn’t the only way to get some rise into your bakes. German yeasted cakes are a wonder – wholesome and weighty; as close as a sweet can get to lunch, and all the better for it. If you’re baking bread, set aside a bit of the leavened dough for Felicity Cloake’s perfect plum cake, German baking expert Luisa Weiss’s Apfelkuchen or the myriad other cinnamon, cardamom and honey-scented options to be found elsewhere.
No flour of any kind
In one of her more daring moves, Anna Jones makes a lemon cake with cannellini beans, ground almonds and four eggs. It is a stone-cold winner – fudgy, rich and sweet. For something more decadent, try the classic flourless chocolate cake. The recipe I have used for years is as follows: melt 200g butter with 100g dark chocolate over a bain-marie, then mix four egg yolks with 100g sugar, and fold that into the chocolate mix. In another bowl, beat the egg whites into stiff peaks, gradually adding a further 100g sugar, then fold into the chocolate mix and bake in a buttered tin at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas mark 4 for 45 minutes or until set in the middle. Serve with whipped cream, Greek yoghurt or creme fraiche – if you have any – and a dusting of icing sugar.
No sugar

Bakers keen to avoid refined sugar have plenty of options, such as syrups (maple, agave, date), fruit (dried and fresh) and sweet root veg (carrots, sweet potato). Nadia Lim does a beautiful banana loaf with coconut. Leela Cyd does one with dates. But having no sugar in lockdown times may call for a more 1950s approach. In her new book, Oats in the North & Wheat from the South, Regula Ysewijn makes a very old-school slab of parkin using only tinned sweeteners: heat up 200g golden syrup with 45g treacle and 200g butter, then mix in 200g oat flour (just blitz up some oats in a food processor if you have none), another 100g oats that have been less finely blitzed, 2 tsp each of bicarb and ground ginger, a pinch each of nutmeg and salt, one egg and 2 tbsp whisky (or milk). Bake at 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas mark 3 for about an hour then leave it to cool in the tin. (As an aside, Ysewijn says: “Never fan! Fan is super-evil and should be avoided at all times!”)
If your stockpiling involved stashing away a tin of Nestlé Carnation instead, you could opt for this recipe from Australia (although obviously you won’t want to sprinkle icing sugar on top).
No eggs
Vegan bakers have a few tricks up their sleeves. Mix 1 tbsp chia seeds or milled flaxseeds with 3 tbsp water and set aside for 15-20 minutes, and you have what’s known as a vegan egg, which generally works as a direct swap-in, say, for a brownie or a loaf cake. If your recipe calls for whipped-up egg whites, as it may for an airy sponge, you can (with some effort) whip up aquafaba (AKA chickpea brine) into frothy white peaks. Again, 3 tbsp is the equivalent of one egg and 2 tbsp for an egg white; Anna Jones tells you what to do here.

Or take a tip from Ruby Tandoh’s moist chocolate fudge cake. Where most recipes caution that you should not overmix the batter once you have added in the flour, Tandoh’s solution for not using eggs is to do exactly that. You flavour the mix with sweet spices, sweeten it with dates and brown sugar and then beat it for a good minute to give it some structure. Once baked, it is slathered with a mix of melted dark chocolate and golden syrup.
No butter
This one is easy. Use olive oil. Ideally you’d make Maialino’s version with Grand Marnier and orange, but Rachel Roddy does an excellent stand-in with ricotta (which you could replace with strained full-fat yoghurt) and lemon. The citrus or dairy gives the bake a good tang, but I would happily eat a really basic one, too, flavoured only with vanilla essence (such as this Kim Boyce recipe, only using plain flour and without the chocolate or rosemary.) And then there’s the similarly basic French gateau au yaourt. Clotilde Dusoulier’s version calls for vegetable oil, but I’ve tried with the dregs of many bottles, and it’s always a winner.
No fat of any kind
The beauty of yoghurt lies in the fluffy, tangy, moist crumb it fashions, with or without added fat. Thomasina Miers’ version uses Greek yoghurt, four eggs and a remarkably tiny amount (35g) of plain flour, with lemon, pistachio and cardamom for flavour. The BBC, meanwhile, lists an entirely fatless sponge (filled, with delicious irony, with a huge amount of whipped cream) that is so striking it deserves a try.
No dairy
Another doozy. If you haven’t tasted a clementine cake, like the one with which Ben Stiller’s Walter Mitty wins over hostile Afghan warlords, you simply haven’t lived. I love the fact that using the whole fruit brings bulk, liquid and flavour. Nigella’s recipe is my go-to: boil up four clementines (I’ve done it with a couple of oranges, too), then blitz them to a pulp. This is then used as the base for a batter of egg, sugar, ground almonds and a little baking powder.
No raising agent of any kind (ie eggs, baking powder, bicarb, self-raising flour)
Meera Sodha’s superlative chocolate, olive oil and passion fruit cake would fit several categories here, featuring neither eggs, dairy nor raising agent of any type. It’s a treasure of a recipe. Ysewijn suggests Cornish heavy cake (also in her new book). Essentially a giant rock cake, it has been made since well before there were things such as self-raising flour; her recipe dates from 1920. You roughly mix 50g each of butter and lard with 340g plain flour, 50g sugar and a tsp of salt. Pour in 125ml of milk or water and knead to combine, before adding 180g currants and 50g candied peel and kneading again. The dough is then set aside for an hour or two, before being baked in a tin, sprinkled with sugar, at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas mark 5 for 40-50 minutes.

No oven
This should be where your cake plans hit a wall. But no. No-bake fridge cakes are a thing, and Cloake’s perfect no-bake cheesecake is hard to beat: a base of buttery, syrupy cornflakes, a filling of lemon-spiked cream cheese and ricotta, a two-hour chill in the fridge. Cornflakes! Of course you’re making this right now.

A group of 24 senior diplomats and defence officials, including four former Nato secretary generals, have urged Donald Trump to save “potentially hundreds of thousands of lives” across the Middle East by easing medical and humanitarian sanctions on Iran.



US ignores calls to suspend Venezuela and Iran sanctions amid coronavirus pandemic







Read more





The call has the backing of the former EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini, the former director general of the World Health Organization Gro Harlem Brundtland, and senior American diplomats in the Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations.
Trump reimposed crippling sanctions on Tehran in May 2018 after withdrawing from an international deal that put curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme.
The bipartisan group is not pressing for a generalised lifting of the sanctions but instead a targeted effort to ease US rules that prevent Tehran trading in medical and humanitarian goods. The group says the move “could potentially save the lives of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Iranians and, by helping to curb the virus’s rapid spread across borders, the lives of its neighbours, Europeans, Americans and others”.
Iranians are facing “one of their country’s darkest times in living memory” the group says. “Reaching across borders to save lives is imperative for our own security and must override political differences among governments,” it adds.
Signatories include the former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright, former US defence secretaries William Cohen and Chuck Hagel, former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency Hans Blix, former US treasury secretary Paul O’Neill, the former US lead diplomat on the Iran deal, William Burns, and the former Nato secretary general George Robertson.

Centrist and progressive Democrats including Joe Biden have all called for a lifting of sanctions, but the statement – organised by the European Leadership Network and the Iran Project – is the most broad-based effort to engage the White House yet,proposing very specific, but effective steps that do not require a complete reversal of US policy towards Iran.
The statement says: “Though never intended to kill, US ‘maximum pressure’ through sanctions on Iran are compromising the performance of the Iranian healthcare system as Iran’s outbreak moves into its second month. Despite humanitarian exemptions provided under US and international law, these sanctions make the importation of medicine, medical equipment and raw materials needed to produce these goods domestically slower, more expensive, and complicated.”

The US state department claims medical trade is not blocked by US sanctions, but the group of former leaders say they have identified a series of barriers that make medical trade near impossible. The steps they recommend include expanding the scope of humanitarian exemptions under US sanctions specifically to include devices and equipment necessary to effectively combat Covid-19, providing extra resources to the US treasury to process sanctions-waiver requests, and sending general US treasury comfort letters to European banks, shipping firms and insurers.
The signatories urge Trump not to use America’s voting rights on the IMF board to disrupt an Iranian request for a $5bn(£4bn) IMF loan, and to issue a statement supporting the use of Instex, the mechanism created by the UK, France and Germany in 2019 to allow European companies to trade with Iran without exposing themselves to the consequences of US sanctions. Iran was not on the first IMF list of countries to be granted coronavirus-linked loans.
The group warns of “significant and long-lasting consequences for the reputation of the United States and Europe among the Iranian people” if Trump does not provide relief. “This would starkly raise the political costs of engaging with either the US or Europe for any current or future Iranian decision-makers, while simultaneously boosting the influence of Iran’s non-western partners”.
Iran deaths per day coronavirus
Trump has claimed Iran does privately want US aid, but the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, under pressure from hardliners, has denied this.
On Monday, Abbas Mousavi, a foreign ministry spokesman, said Iran would never ask the US for help. “Iran has never asked and will not ask America to help Tehran in its fight against the outbreak ... but America should lift all its illegal, unilateral sanctions on Iran,” Mousavi said in a televised news conference.
Iran’s own messaging on the need for external aid is also confused, with some leaders saying the country is self-sufficient, and others insisting there are dire shortages.
Iran formally withdrew criticism of Chinese coronavirus statistics after the health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, had on Sunday described the Chinese figures as a joke in a tweet and at a press conference.
Iran’s death toll stood at 3,739 on Monday, with more than 60,500 infected. There is no sign of any fall in the numbers being infected, as many Iranians return to work after the Iranian new year holiday. Concern remains within the Iranian government that too many Iranians are still ignoring social distancing guidelines.

The Debenhams department store chain is to file for administration and has described the conditions facing retailers as “unprecedented.”
It is the second time in a year that the chain, which has more than 140 stores and 22,000 staff, has appointed administrators.
Last year the debt-laden company was taken over by its lenders, and this time the management said the business needed the protection that the administration procedure provides, as some creditors were threatening legal action that could push the business into liquidation. The creditors are likely to be suppliers who have not been paid for stock they have provided.
The retailer’s creditors will now be prevented from pursuing legal action for 10 working days while the company tries to secure a new rescue deal.
The retailer has been battling the effects of £600m of debt, tough competition and the downturn on the high street. It has closed 22 stores this year and has plans to close a total of 50 outlets across the UK.
Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the company’s chief executive, said he was working with landlords and pension trustees and “striving to protect jobs and reopen as many Debenhams stores as we can, as soon as this is possible.”

The majority of the group’s employees in the UK are already being paid under the government’s furlough scheme following its order for all non-essential stores to close. The retailer has also written to its landlords asking for a five-month rent holiday
Debenhams is continuing to trade online across the UK, Ireland and Denmark, and customer orders, gift cards and returns are being accepted and processed normally.
Julie Palmer, a partner at insolvency firm Begbies Traynor.said: “Debenhams has been in financial difficulties for a while so this doesn’t come as a major surprise, but it will leave its 20,000-plus strong workforce in a precarious position during the ongoing uncertainty.”
Debenhams is one of many retailers in financial difficulties because of the coronavirus shutdown.
Since the lockdown began, several other chains including New Look and Topshop owner, Arcadia, have declined to pay their rent and furloughed their staff. Two of Britain’s largest shopping centre owners, Intu Properties and Hammerson, reported that they had received about only a third of rent due from their tenants for the second quarter of the year on its due date at the end of March.
An extended period of store closures has left an estimated £10bn of clothing piling up in warehouses.

Name: Lockdown erotica.
Age: Two weeks.
Appearance: Unbelievably sexy.
Surely you can’t film pornography at a time like this. No, of course you can’t. But this isn’t pornography. It’s erotica.
Pardon? Dirty novels.
Oh. You’ll hear all about it soon. Several enterprising authors have already rushed out their own sexy ebooks, specifically about situations surrounding the lockdown. If you have a Kindle or Kindle app, you can read them today.
What sort of books are we talking about? Well, there is Covid-69: An Erotic Coronavirus Quarantine Story by J Andrews. And Sex During the Coronavirus Pandemic (tagline: “They could lock down her country, but never her heart”). And FFM Lockdown. And The Physical Manifestation of Washing My Hands Gets Me Off, in which a woman begins a lesbian affair with the physical manifestation of the concept of hand-washing.
Please stop. There is also Quaranteen: Step-Sibling Love in the Time of the Coronavirus; and Love in Lockdown, in which the main character says: “Death has his tongue in your mouth, his long fingers around your breasts.”
Done? For now. There will be hundreds more of them in a week, though.
But why? Oh, loads of reasons. You can’t write traditional erotica now because it wouldn’t ring true. There are no chance encounters any more. The plumber doesn’t come to visit. Your personal trainer has to stay two metres from you. Your babysitter has been declared nonessential. Your child’s teacher now gives you feedback solely through Google Classroom. Erotica has to adapt, or it will die.
Why else? People are bored and horny. That’s it.
Why has this only happened with sexy books? In truth, it hasn’t. Since going into lockdown, Amazon has been flooded with coronavirus-related ebooks. There are self-help quarantine dating books, children’s stories, investment guides, workout manuals, parenting books.
But mainly erotica. Yes. And religious books, weirdly. Once you get bored with getting yourself off, why not read something like Christ Is King, Not Coronavirus: A Christian Response to Our Current Pandemic?
Can’t I just read normal books that aren’t about the outbreak? Sure, you could, but that would be missing the point.
And what point is that? That we are living through a moment in history. These books are historical artefacts. A century from now, our descendants will look back at 2020 with puzzlement. The existence of stories such as FFM Lockdown and Quaranteen will show them how we coped.
Do say: “Shakespeare wrote King Lear under quarantine.”
Don’t say: “And today I finished writing my novella Blowvid-19, so I’m practically a bard.”

Boris Johnson is still in hospital suffering from coronavirus and had a “comfortable night” but No 10 has dropped the description of his symptoms as mild.
As the prime minister continues to be observed by doctors, Downing Street said it was too early to say whether he would be staying for another night and did not deny that he had been given oxygen treatment.
The prime minister’s official spokesman said he was in St Thomas’ hospital in south London and was in “good spirits”, while continuing to work on his red box of government papers.
Asked whether Johnson had pneumonia, the spokesman said any change in his condition would be communicated to the public. He still has a cough and a temperature, more than 11 days after first reporting symptoms.
No 10 insisted it had been “transparent throughout” Johnson’s illness, despite having described the prime minister’s symptoms as mild right up until his hospital admission. Johnson himself only admitted to still having a temperature, not a cough, in his video message on Friday morning. No 10 has now changed its description of his symptoms to “persistent”.
Two Tory ministers – Nadine Dorries and James Duddridge – have suggested Johnson needs to rest.
However, No 10 said he was taking advice from his doctors on whether it was safe for him to continue working and was still in touch with No 10 officials from his hospital bed. 
Earlier, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, insisted Johnson was fit enough to lead the country from his hospital bed after he was admitted with persistent coronavirus symptoms.

What do the restrictions involve?

People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:
Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible
One form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household
Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person

Johnson was admitted on Sunday evening with a high fever on the advice of his doctor, with Downing Street saying he was undergoing routine tests. He was kept in overnight.
Most coronavirus patients stay in hospital for more than a week. However, Jenrick told BBC Breakfast: “We all hope and expect that he can get back to No 10 very soon.”
If his condition worsens, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is the designated minister to take charge. Raab chaired a Monday morning meeting of the government’s C-19 committee, which is leading the response to the pandemic. However, Tuesday’s cabinet meeting has been cancelled.
The pound fell against the dollar and euro overnight on Monday as foreign exchange markets took fright at the possibility of Johnson being out of action. The prime minister had been hoping to leave quarantine on Friday but his persistent temperature meant he had to remain inside his flat at No 11 Downing Street.
The Guardian was told last week that Johnson was more seriously ill than either he or his officials were prepared to admit, and that he was being seen by doctors who were concerned about his breathing.

But Downing Street flatly denied the prime minister’s health had seriously deteriorated, and insisted there were no plans at that point for him to be admitted to hospital.
Asked if it was time for colleagues in the cabinet and civil service to tell Johnson to rest, Jenrick told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “He has worked phenomenally hard, as have many people across the country. This has been a uniquely intense period and I know for him personally it will be very frustrating that he has had to go to hospital to have these tests.
“He will want to be back in No 10 leading from the front, which is his way. But he remains in charge of the government; he will be updated regularly in hospital, as he has been as he’s self-isolating.”
 On Sunday, Matt Hancock was asked just how ill the prime minister was. The health secretary told Sophy Ridge on Sky News: “He’s OK. I’ve been talking to him every day, several times a day … he’s very much got his hand on the tiller. But he’s still got a temperature.”
Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, revealed on Saturday that she had also contracted the virus but was recovering.

While No 10 did not say what tests Johnson would have in hospital, experts said they would be likely to focus on assessing how the prime minister’s lungs, heart and other organs were responding to the virus.
“Doctors will be monitoring important vital signs such as oxygen saturations,” said Dr Rupert Beale, who heads the cell biology of infection laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London.
“They will also check blood tests to see what the immune response to the virus looks like, and to assess liver and kidney function. They will perform an electrocardiogram to check the heart. More sophisticated tests may include a CT scan of the chest to get an accurate picture of the lungs.”

With Johnson in hospital, the ministers involved in the government’s coronavirus response will be looking ahead to next weekend, which is the point at which it will have to extend or end the lockdown.
Jenrick signalled the lockdown was unlikely to be lifted at the end of the week, saying some of the most challenging weeks were probably still to come. As communities secretary, he said the government “desperately” did not want to shut parks but it could happen if people continued to congregate for picnics.
Critics of the government are concerned that ministers have not identified a way out of the lockdown, with doubts about its ability to scale up testing for live cases and the efficacy of new antibody tests to find out whether people have had the virus.
The former prime minister Tony Blair called for a senior minister to “take charge of testing, and nothing else, with people with business experience of how you ramp up industrial scale production”.
He said it was not the right choice for an epidemiologist to be in charge of this effort, after the government put Prof John Newton of Public Health England in charge.
“Unless you are able to get mass testing at scale, with speed, I don’t see how you can get a way out of this lockdown and I am terrified by the economic damage we are doing with every week this lockdown continues,” Blair told the Today programme.
“This damage is enormous … If it goes on for a long time then it doesn’t just affect the economy per se, it also affects the ability to operate your healthcare service effectively.”
His comments echo the calls of the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has for more than a week advocated a return to mass community testing to suppress virus hotspots where they arise.

Lombardy is one of the richest and most productive regions in Italy and Bergamo is its beating heart. It is also my home town: the city where I spent my childhood and adolescence. The province’s million inhabitants are characterised by a strong sense of belonging: to region and to family. They take pride too in a no-nonsense, practical approach to life and a powerful work ethic.
Today, Bergamo holds the European record that no town wants: it is the place where the coronavirus pandemic has cast its darkest shadow. Bergamo is a lazaretto of pain, where the priority of hospital managers is to select only the patients they think will survive. Its undertakers are so overwhelmed they have to ask neighbouring communes to take their corpses for cremation.
Italy’s death toll from this pandemic passed 15,000 on 4 April, although the number of actual deaths is probably higher. Bergamo, the most infected province in Italy, has had 9,712 confirmed cases and 2,245 deaths according to the official data. An investigation by the Eco di Bergamo newspaper estimates that in Bergamo province alone the virus killed 4,500 people in March.



Italy records lowest coronavirus death toll for a week

The rate of loss of life feels out of control to local people and defies all understanding. Forced confinement, physical distancing and care for the weakest seem futile. The virus seemed to defeat any effort, annihilate any commitment. Here, no one took to singing on balconies, to giving concerts online: the place is in perpetual mourning.
But was the initial reluctance to shut down Bergamo’s factories and thriving economy a factor in spreading the infection?
To grasp that first reaction it helps to understand just how efficient and solid the economic and industrial fabric here has been for generations. The province has Italy’s biggest concentration of the country’s best-performing small and medium-sized enterprises, clustered mostly in the lower Bergamo region. But it is also home to big international companies such as Brembo, which makes automotive braking systems, and Kiko, the international cosmetics brand founded by Antonio Percassi, also president of the local football team, Atalanta. Some Bergamo success stories such as the drinks company San Pellegrino, now owned by Nestlé, have been absorbed by multinationals.
The three Alpine valleys of the province have more farms than businesses. The small towns that make up these valleys have strong rural communities that maintain their traditions at parish level, but can feel closed in on themselves. Everyone knows everyone else, many elderly people still speak the dialect, and even teenagers stick close to home.
The city of Bergamo by contrast could hardly be more open: it is directly linked to the main European capitals by Orio al Serio airport (also known as Milan/Bergamo), which is a hub for Ryanair and had nearly 14 million passengers in 2019. These frequent connections are an important source of tourism for the city. 
In 1913, the German-Swiss writer and intellectual Hermann Hesse visited Bergamo and observed: “I was greeted by a modern railway station and a modern city … the evening stroll was crowded and the tramway crowded.” Then he took the funicular to reach the upper town, the historical part of the city surrounded by Venetian walls, “below me, the nightlife of the city was off … here I was in the middle of an ancient and dark city, swallowed up by a narrow and deserted alleyway, just as the shops were closing … it suddenly seemed to me that I was in southern Tuscany”.
Hesse immediately grasped the duality of Bergamo: modern and ancient, economically open to the world but closed in on its traditions. On the one hand, a strong social and cultural life linked by voluntary work through the Catholic church. On the other, a remarkable focus on productivity, work, the family and above all the family business.
It is clear looking back that this rich and dynamic city struggled to come to a halt when the virus arrived. For the Bergamaschi, work and self-reliance have always been fundamental values. But faced with a health emergency, was a strong business ethic a tragic disadvantage?
By 23 February, the virus had already infected Val Seriana, the Bergamo valley where two villages, Alzano Lombardo and Nembro, quickly became the ground zero of the epidemic in the region.
Four days earlier, on 19 February, an Atalanta-Valencia Champions League football match was attended by 45,000 fans in Milan, an event widely blamed for having accelerated the spread across the region.
The contagion reached Codogno (a small town in Lodi province, 65km from Bergamo) two days after the game, and Codogno was immediately made a “red zone”, in other words quarantined with police checkpoints guarding entry and exit. By contrast, in Bergamo schools closed, but there was resistance to any sweeping stay-at-home measures until 8 March when all of Lombardy went into full lockdown.
The Italian government had declared a nationwide health emergency on 31 January but Stefano Scaglia, the president of Confindustria Bergamo, which represents 1,200 businesses employing 80,000 people, offered reassurance. On 29 February, the organisation published a message in English aimed at the region’s international export partners, accompanied by the hashtag “#Bergamoisrunning”. Drawing on the Italian government’s advice it said “the risk of infection is low” and warned against “a distorted perception” created by the media. Confindustria could guarantee that “the government and responsible agencies have taken immediate protective measures to prevent further cases”. Scaglia’s message to global business: work goes on, we remain open.

I was still in Bergamo when the body which represents local shops posted a promotional video accompanied by the hashtag #bergamononsiferma. A song by a local band accompanying images of Bergamo people peacefully ambling through the heart of the city seemed a bit too cheerful. The message was “let’s live without fear, let’s keep drinking coffee at the bar”. Bergamo’s mayor, Giorgio Gori, had earlier sent out optimistic messages, stressing that whatever strain the virus was putting on tourism, catering and commerce, the city would quickly put this “nightmare” behind it. Everyone’s desire was to continue working and consuming in spite of everything.
Within weeks, army vehicles would be transporting corpses to other cities and hospital doctors were warning that the situation in Bergamo was “catastrophic” and out of control. 
Now in the mourning city and province, many people in Bergamo have abandoned their former quiet pragmatism.
In the absence of work and the rational, efficient world they knew, blind anger is creeping in at what they see as official negligence. The most important failing, they believe, was not to impose a lockdown sooner, to shut the factories and businesses and keep people in their homes.



Singing stops in Italy as fear and social unrest mount

I can see attitudes hardening too: people are looking for explanations and some are spreading baseless theories. In the many WhatsApp groups in which people share information and encouragement, conspiracy theories are cropping up more and more. “Why are so few immigrants getting sick?” “The Chinese grew the virus in a laboratory to weaken us!”
In 2019 Bergamo had the second lowest unemployment rate in Italy. Now a major economic crisis, especially in the industrial and tourism sectors, seems inevitable.
It’s not hard to see the far right taking advantage of the dark mood. Bergamo city is governed by the centre-left Democratic party. The province though is a stronghold for Matteo Salvini’s Lega.
And people are looking for someone to blame. Facebook messages rant about Europe and “selfish” Germany. “Get out of the EU, get rid of the euro, reset the government and drive out immigrants,” reads one post. Another asks: “Germany is stealing our masks, France is spitting on us, what kind of shitty Europe is this?”
Some will see this as a region lashing out and falling for populist slogans. I see my city distraught and destroyed by grief: people drawing on their last reserves of mental strength to make sense of the unimaginable. But I also see signs of hope in their resilience and solidarity: last week, volunteers, Alpini (elite Italian army troops), craftsmen and Atalanta fans completed work on a new field hospital in 10 days.
As they worked they chanted: “People like us never give up.”

So, is the coronavirus bringing people together?Chantal, by email
Roll on, ye olde blitz spirit! We were promised that innately British pluck, the kind that had housewives chatting among the remains of their bombed-out houses as the Queen stopped by to give them tea, would get Britain through this plague. It was supposed to get us through the ravages of Brexit. (Remember that? Hilarious!) Yet the global plague superseded that, which is a bit like being mid-shark attack, only for you and the shark to be swallowed suddenly by a T rex.
Anyway – the blitz! Even the Queen referenced the second world war in her Sunday night address to the nation, because of course she did. Alas, it turns out this famous blitz spirit may have been as much of a myth as the benefits of Brexit, with some of the most famous photos from the blitz, such as the milkman doing his rounds through ruined houses, having long been exposed as fakes.
As for the reports of wartime British solidarity, these too have been greatly exaggerated. For example, there were reports of middle-class families in the countryside worrying that housing evacuated working-class children would result in “the spoliation of decent homes and furniture [or] the corruption of speech or moral standards of our own children”. Yay, blitz spirit!
Which brings us to Britain today. How is that famed blitz spirit holding up? Well, it seemed to me that, for the first week after the sort-of-kind-of-lockdown began, it was doing OK. Putting to one side the fear of death and the death of loved ones, there was a kind of national fascination that we were all going through such a collective event. Sporting successes are few and far between, so there was a novelty in all of us knowing where almost every person in the country was (in their sitting room) and that we were all experiencing the same emotions (anxiety to boredom and back again). And then, after a week, maybe even 10 days, things turned.
The signs were always there, with the early bursts of frantic stockpiling and – perhaps more telling, in retrospect – the furious tutting over said stockpiling. Because it seems to me – from my admittedly limited vantage point of reading the internet, Zooming with friends and daily 15-minute outings with the dog – that what was once a collective experience has now broken down into factions, each one snarling at the other.
There are those who insist that people need to stop going to the park and that a walk round the block should suffice for even the most hyperactive toddler. Then there are those who wonder how the other people have gone through life without ever meeting a toddler. There are the solo isolaters, bored and lonely. There are the stressed home-schooling parents, who would rip out their own hair for empty hours of solitude. There are the people with gardens who don’t understand why so many people insist on going for walks. There are the people without gardens who desperately need some vitamin D. There are the people who fearfully run off to their second homes versus those who think these people are immoral and selfish; the achievers who believe now is the time for them to write their King Lear versus the sloths who think the achievers are show-offs who should chill and watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine; and, of course, walkers versus joggers, which is the new cyclists versus drivers.
On top of everyone looking at others and thinking they all have it easier, as if they are somehow cheating physical distancing, there is the general collective tutting. The daily tutting photos on social media of crowded parks, taken by people who don’t understand that they are, in fact, part of the crowd. As a Dutch advert put it in 2010: “You are not in traffic. You are traffic.” Every time I hear shouts of laughter in the street outside my house, I see my neighbours rush to the window, determined to tut at some wrongdoers – and I see my neighbours doing this because I am doing it, too.
We are not living through the blitz, but we are fighting something unseeable and completely terrifying. So, in the absence of a concrete enemy, we vent our anger and anxiety on one another. It is understandable, even if it is not very nice. No matter what anyone says, this experience is not the same for all of us: some of us live in houses, some in flats, some are drowning in toddlers, some are not. But we are all pretty scared. So, even if the material details between us remain as unequal and unfair as ever, on an emotional level, this is a helluva leveller. And that is something to remember.

The collective challenge we face in the kitchen has come as a shock to us all. The sudden shortages, the constant meal planning, the rationing of fresh ingredients and the eking out of every last scrap ...
There’s no doubt that these are good habits to get into, and that this period has the potential to make better cooks of us all. We might become more conscious about food waste, realise we don’t need to eat meat as much as we thought we did, grow more creative with the ingredients we have available.
Below are 10 recipes from my archive that I’m revisiting most at the moment: nourishing, hearty family meals that give us the goodness we need as resourcefully as possible. If, like me, you suddenly find yourself at home with children, some of these make an excellent diversion for little hands and big appetites.
The perfect rice salad (main picture)
Apples, carrot, nuts, raisins, herbs, and the eponymous rice, a dish that’s packed with both flavour and nutrition, making it a brilliant lunchtime filler for all the family. If you don’t have the wild rice I suggest in the recipe, use whatever you have, such as basmati.

Comforting, utterly delicious and cheap as chips! My children were fascinated by how to make baked beans from scratch and to see how the various ingredients add different levels of flavour. Leave out the meat for a veggie version, and the eggs and sour cream for vegans.

This macaroni cheese is a great way to make a bit of cheese go a long way and is spiked with broccoli, giving the whole family all the nutrition it needs to stay happy and well.
Parsnip gratin (or any other root) with apple allioli
If you are finding eggs hard to find in the shops try making this silky, indulgent and incredibly delicious Catalan-inspried allioli, using apples to bind the mayonnaise instead of the normal egg. Layer it over sliced parsnips with hints of garlic and toasted nuts for a magical, warming gratin.

Sweet soft wedges of red onions cooked in butter and balsamic vinegar popped into pastry with blue cheese, thyme and black pepper.
Mexican chilli
The rich, warming spices so loved in Mexico add delicious layers of flavour to this fun, family dish. The sweet onions, tomatoes and pulses make the small amount of meat go a long way adding extra bang for your buck in terms of key protein.

The tomato sauce can be made in minutes with tins from the cupboard, leaving you to focus on making the dumplings. Experiment with different greens and get young people involved.
Spinach and feta pie
The glorious flavours and textures at play here – buttery, crispy pastry filled with salty feta and sweet spinach – belie the simplicity of the recipe. It makes a killer of a lunch or dinner with remarkably little fuss.

Smoky roast veg with goat’s cheese and toasted nuts
These roasted roots are infinitely adaptable – swap vegetables in and out, try feta if you haven’t got goat’s cheese, and, while saba is hard to get hold of at the moment, I suggest reducing some balsamic vinegar to a syrupy glaze in its place.

Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:
Hope across Europe lockdowns are starting to show results
With deaths in Spain declining for the fourth consecutive day, Italy reporting its lowest death toll in two weeks and France recording a decline in new hospital admissions, there is tentative hope across Europe that lockdowns are starting to show results.
Austria to lift some lockdown restrictions
Austria became the first European country to announce plans to lift its lockdown, with some shops being reopened from next week, and Spain said it would start widespread testing as a first step towards slowly easing restrictions.
Second night in hospital not ruled out for Boris Johnson
The communities secretary Robert Jenrick has not ruled out the prime minister spending more nights in hospital but said he expects him to return to Number 10 “shortly”. Jenrick said he had heard Johnson is “doing well” and hopes he will be back in Downing Street soon. Asked if the PM will spend more nights in hospital, Jenrick said: “He will obviously take the advice of doctors and nurses who are doing those tests and act accordingly.” He insisted Johnson remains in day-to-day charge of the government.
Japan prepares for state of emergency
Meanwhile, Japan’s government is poised to declare a state of emergency on Tuesday after a surge in coronavirus cases in Tokyo. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is also expected to announce an “unprecedented” 108 trillion yen ($989bn) package in response to the “biggest crisis” the global economy has faced since the second world war, a draft document has revealed.
Airlines suspend more flights
In airline news, British Airways announced it would be suspending direct flights between Japan and the UK, and American Airlines Group Inc said late Sunday it would suspend more flights in and out of New York City’s three main airports for about a month.
Indonesia records biggest daily jump in cases
Indonesia recorded its biggest daily jump in cases, with 218 confirmed on Monday, and the Philippines recorded 414 new infections. Russia also recorded its biggest daily jump, with 954 new cases of the disease.
Bronx tiger has Covid-19
A tiger at New York City’s Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the coronavirus, in the first known case of Covid-19 in an animal in the US. But a veterinary expert says cat owners shouldn’t panic.

It might seem like a holiday for some, but the school closures, cancelled exams and university shutdowns are wreaking havoc with many students’ lives. Sixth formers have lost the chance to improve their grades through last-minute revision, and university students have been left hanging, unable to sit their final exams, say goodbye to friends, or invite their families to graduation ceremonies. 
Students from different stages in their education tell how their plans for the future are being shaped by the crisis.

Sukhdip Nagra
A-level student, Leicester High School for Girls
“Everyone was scared on the last few days of sixth form, with lots of people self-isolating. We were told on Wednesday that we had two days to say goodbye; it felt rushed. We don’t know what’s going to happen next or when we’ll see each other.
I was going to put everything into my revision around Easter. In January when you’ve got mocks your priority isn’t revision, and then there’s other deadlines to meet – coursework, personal statements, Ucas applications. Teacher attainment grades don’t take that into consideration.
Now I’ve lost the motivation to continue revising as I have lost sight of what I will be working towards. The conflicting information from teachers, who are also uncertain, has left us students confused. 
I fear that all schools will not be held to the same regulations, with some recommending students do essays as evidence of their grade. This system could disadvantage students with a poor relationship with their teacher and BAME students, who tend to exceed their predicted grades. I would prefer exams to be postponed. 
Because there have been a lot of articles about the cap on university places, everyone was worried about theirs being taken away. My application didn’t need to be firmed until 4 May, but I didn’t want my place getting taken away so I firmed out of fear. Although I do think I made the right decision, I feel I should have taken more time to make it.”


Andrew Gallagher
First-year journalism student, Ulster University
“Because of the staff strikes and now the coronavirus outbreak, I’ve only had four physical classes in my first year. The rest have been online. It feels like we’re being left high and dry with very little support. We’ve had very few contact hours. Ideally I’d like a reduced fee next year, or a bit of money back.
However we have technically still been ‘taught’ throughout the outbreak. And obviously with the strikes, reducing our fees is only going to reduce money available to the staff who were on strike for better pay, so that doesn’t really sound fair.

The online teaching has been OK. But I haven’t had video classes, which most of the other courses do – they’ve just put up PowerPoints and lecture notes for us that we’ve had to read through. So you have less of the explanation, and it’s a lot more effort if you’re having issues with something. 
You’ve got to email your lecturer and then wait for a response, whereas in an actual lecture you’d have a response instantly. We were also learning to use Adobe software, but the university won’t shell out for all of us to download it, so that’s a few months of useful learning down the drain.”

Callum Sheridan-Lee
Acting student, Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts
“We’re in a limbo. We were in the middle of our final shows, halfway through rehearsals, then everything got cancelled. The school’s doing its best to keep the teaching online, but with acting it’s difficult to practise your craft without being in a room with other actors and the director. 
At the moment our shows are postponed indefinitely and we’re just waiting for information. Either they’ll postpone and we’ll go back into rehearsals later, or they’ll cancel them and replace it with some kind of written assessment, which would be a shame.
It would be a difficult time anyway, that first year out of university. Our third year was meant to be about getting us out into the industry: getting agents and meetings with casting directors. It’s about launching the first year of your acting career. 
But nothing’s happening in the industry – shows have been cancelled, and casting directors aren’t meeting with people. The casting directors don’t have any work either. Some of them are doing callouts for show reels online to support acting grads.
In your third year, you’re also saying goodbye to a lot of people you might never see again. My flatmate is from Iceland, and he suddenly had to go home. There’s this sense of ‘is that it? Is that the last time I see you for the next few years?’ It’s a weird time.”
Caitlin Cassel
Final-year philosophy student, University of Reading
“I’m a bit fed up. I’ve spent three years working hard to maintain a good grade and now, with the anxiety of everything going on, it’s hard to get anything done.

I have a chronic disability, which means I struggle with going to lectures and other things. It’s funny how they’ve now put lectures online, which they wouldn’t normally do for disabled students like me. But they can suddenly do it now everyone’s impacted.
My graduation has been postponed. A lot of people might not be able to attend theirs now. It feels like we’ve worked so hard for this big moment, and it’s been taken away. Obviously you can’t predict a global pandemic, but it’s tough.
The university has offered deadline extensions and exam retakes, but it doesn’t really work for final-year students. A lot of us will be starting jobs, internships or master’s programmes. 
We’ve asked for a ‘no detriment’ policy because we have no access to materials in the library. This would mean any work we hand in now doesn’t negatively affect our overall grades if it’s below standard. But the university said no. I’ve still got 45% of my final-year assessments to submit. It’s very tough.”

Alice O’Driscoll
Final year PhD student, University of Cambridge“The archives and libraries that I depend on were understandably shut with very little notice so I grabbed what books I could. I don’t have all the resources I need to keep working so I’m tinkering at the edges of my thesis. So many of the ‘lightbulb’ moments that have occurred over my studies have been instigated by conversations with other students or fellows with completely different research interests. I’m feeling very anxious. These are not conducive circumstances for work at the moment, with the amount of worry I’m feeling for my family.
I got engaged on 16 March, a few hours before Boris Johnson’s press conference discouraging non-essential contact. We haven’t been able to see any of our friends to celebrate. But we’re thrilled, and wedding planning has given us something other than work to think about while we’re cooped up in our college accommodation.
Like a lot of postgraduate students I do part-time work to supplement my income. I had a zero-hours contract, the flexibility of which really suited me, but now that’s dried up I’m £50 per week worse off.
I have friends working on historical epidemics and plagues who are tweaking their research grant applications to highlight the sudden, painful relevance of their topics. I study sieges in seventeenth-century Britain and Ireland. Accounts which emphasise the claustrophobic intimacy of besiegement and the fear of diseases which swept through enclosed spaces, strike me a lot more now.”

"88","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-us-medical-students-pandemic","2020-04-06T07:00:00-0400","  As some US medical students heed call to action, others are sidelined amid pandemic ","
Muhammad Sarib Hussain is among a burgeoning number of advanced medical students who have been asked to enlist in the US “war” against the coronavirus outbreak.
Already, a number of schools around the United States have decided to offer their graduating students early diplomas as state officials plead for reinforcements for staff in overburdened and beleaguered hospital systems.
Hussain, a member of Harvard Medical School’s class of 2020, is one of the graduating students who will have the option to quickly deploy into Massachusetts hospitals. He is currently in Pakistan with his family ahead of Ramadan, but he’s leaning toward coming back to the US.
“This was what we signed up for, right?” Hussain said. “If there’s a fire out there, firefighters can’t sort of count themselves out.”
He’s not alone in his sense of duty right now, but he is among the few who have been given a path to action. There’s a much larger army of medical students in the US impatiently awaiting their marching orders even as some of their schools bench them during the greatest fight of their young lives.
“I just feel like I’m being sidelined at a time when the world needs help medically the most, and it’s frustrating for me,” said Haley Shumway, who attends the Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine.
Coronavirus has completely upended medical students’ lives as learning goes virtual, schools restrict direct patient care to varying degrees and graduation ceremonies lose their pomp and circumstance. A student population accustomed to planning years in advance is being told to sit tight even as their country is in dire need of the skill sets and specialties they’ve been developing for years.
“I feel like I’m in this limbo place, where I have training to help, but I’m also being told to stay at home,” said Kelly McDermott, who graduates from Eastern Virginia Medical School this year.

Adam Eddington, a student at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine, was working in pediatrics when he was pulled from patient care by his school. Even though Covid-19 hasn’t affected children as much as other demographics, Eddington gets that it wouldn’t be fair for him to progress normally in his training while so many of his peers can’t. Still, he wrestled with his school’s choice for a bit.
“I think all in all it was the right decision,” he said. “As far as I know, it’s unprecedented, and it’s gonna take a lot of work to make sure that we adapt and move forward to try to get all the experience and get all the qualifications that are necessary to make us really good physicians. But I have faith in the systems in place to try to do that.”
A lot of students learned that they’d be temporarily removed from direct patient care a few weeks ago, around the same time that the Association of American Medical Colleges issued guidance on the subject.
Alison Whelan, chief medical education officer for the AAMC, said her organization encouraged members to suspend clinical experiences because of personal protective equipment shortages, a lack of widely available, rapid testing and the need to limit contact between people as much as possible. She and her colleagues have since reiterated their guidance, unless there’s a critical local need for health care workers.
“A lot of us understand that we aren’t the most essential as medical students, ’cause we’re learning. But at the same time, a lot of us wanted to be involved and wanted to learn how to handle situations like this in the future,” said Sara Grant, a student at the Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine.
The suggestion doesn’t mean students have to stop learning, Whelan said, or even that their rotations have to end. In practice, it’s been handled in different ways, depending on the school.
At Oakland, Grant said she and her classmates were participating in virtual lectures, working through interactive cases and physical exam videos, and doing other supplements to try to troubleshoot for what they were missing in-person. Similarly, Dartmouth moved almost entirely online, and Eddington said students like him suddenly had access to a series of non-clinical electives as well as swiftly organized Covid-19 ethics and microbiology courses.
Shumway wasn’t given guidance from Rocky Vista for a week and a half, beyond studying for exams. But eventually, the school sent an email asking students to fill support roles in and outside the hospital – everything from comforting overflow patients to triaging over the phone.
At the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, students weren’t categorically removed from patient care, except for known or suspected Covid-19 cases.
John Davis, associate dean for curriculum at the school, called it an “educational imperative” to give especially his most advanced learners the opportunity to watch people who are responding to the crisis in real time before they in turn assume some of those responsibilities.
“Ultimately, I do think that the students who are graduating now will graduate with additional skills and competencies that other cohorts might not have had, which is being able to respond to a pandemic,” Davis said.
Students who have had their clinical experiences put on pause aren’t just twiddling their thumbs. Even before Shumway got more detailed direction from her school, she was scrounging up ways to use her medical knowledge outside of a patient care environment. After hearing a lot of dangerous rumors and pseudoscience circulating around the coronavirus pandemic, she decided to make a podcast that set the record straight.
Vitamin C and essential oils can’t cure Covid-19, she explained. Saunas and hot baths won’t prevent infection, either. And swishing vinegar doesn’t do much of anything to fight the disease, despite a meme her friend posted on Facebook claiming otherwise.
“I’m not comparing the common cold to this virus, but the common cold is also a virus. And has your mother ever asked you to go swallow some vinegar to get rid of your cold? No,” she said.
Other students are babysitting for physicians, donating blood, volunteering at food drives, rounding up personal protective equipment from local businesses, or even just providing accurate information to their networks as panic and fake news around the pandemic spreads.
“Those things are meaningful now, and they need to believe that,” Whelan said.
Meanwhile, some are already readying themselves for the next time their country calls.
“Life is really, really short, and it should be spent wearing yourself out, trying to help people,” Eddington said. “And if that means that I get worn out trying to help people in the next pandemic, then that would be fine.”

"89","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/06/millions-us-at-risk-losing-running-water-amid-layoffs-triggered-coronavirus-pandemic","2020-04-06T07:00:00-0400","  Millions in US at risk of 'water shutoffs' amid layoffs triggered by pandemic ","
Millions of Americans risk losing running water if they fall behind with bill payments in coming months, as mass layoffs triggered by the coronavirus pandemic force families to make impossible tradeoffs on paying household expenses.
Around two-fifths of the country rely on water utilities which have not suspended the policy of shutoffs for non-payment, despite public health warnings that good hygiene – specifically frequent hand washing – is crucial to preventing spread of the highly contagious virus, according to data analysed by Food and Water Watch (FWW) and the Guardian.
The virus has spread exponentially in the past month with 336,912 confirmed cases in the US as of Sunday, including 9,615 deaths, according to data collated by the New York Times. An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Americans are expected to die from Covid-19 complications, even if mitigation measures like good hygiene and social distancing are fully implemented.
“This is an emergency and the priority is to stop the spread so this is a no brainer, everyone must have access to water… this should not be a partisan issue,” said congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, who is pushing federal intervention.
In addition to the public health toll, the economic impact of the pandemic is already devastating families, with close to 10 millon people filing for unemployment benefits during the second half of March and an unprecedented spike in demand for emergency aid at food banks. One in two American adults have either no emergency savings or not enough to cover three months of living expenses, according to Bankrate’s 2019 Financial Security Index.
Yet despite the evolving economic and health crises, less than 60% of the population have so far been protected from water shutoffs. And just 11% of these utilities have explicitly pledged to reconnect households currently without running water due to unpaid bills.
“As unemployment reaches record highs, millions of Americans are going to have to choose between paying for food, rent and bills… water is not something people should have to tradeoff,” said Mary Grant, director of water at FWW.
There is no national database tracking shutoffs or the number of US households left without running water. But in 2016, one in every 20 households were disconnected by public water departments, leaving an estimated 15 million Americans without running water.
“Communities most vulnerable to Covid-19 are most vulnerable to water shutoffs”
The highest shutoffs rates were concentrated in southern and rural states including Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida and Oklahoma. Some of the hardest-hit towns and cities including New Orleans, Detroit, Milwaukee, Mecklenburg, Ada and Dekalb are now Covid-19 hot-spots, according to analysis by the Guardian.
In New Orleans, which has the fourth highest rate of coronavirus infection per capita in the country, only 300 households have so far been reconnected and the city does not know how many remain without running water.
“It’s a package of related factors – institutional racism, environmental injustice, and poverty – which means communities most vulnerable to Covid-19 are the same communities most vulnerable to water shutoffs,” said Grant.
So far, the moratoriums on shutoffs include 12 statewide orders, which apply to private and public water providers, issued by the governors of California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin.
On Monday a coalition of community groups were set to call on New York governor Andrew Cuomo to issue a moratorium on price hikes, fines and shutoffs until 180 days after the end of the state of emergency.
Currently, 8.5 million stateside New Yorkers still face the threat of disconnection if they fail to keep up with bills, while the number of households without running water is unknown. Shutoffs have been banned in New York City since before the pandemic, but in Buffalo for example, taps were turned off on 17,000 occasions between 2015 and March 2019. Buffalo has suspended shutoffs but is not reconnecting those without running water.
“Access to water is a poor person’s issue”
Meanwhile, there are signs of some political will to tackle the issue in Washington.
The House version of the third rescue package included $1.5bn to assist low income households with water bills during the crisis, and a condition which required localities and utilities to suspend utility shutoffs in order to qualify for financial aid.
But the clauses were left out of the final bill approved by the senate on 26 March.
Instead, congressional Democrats want $12bn for water subsidies in the fourth rescue package, with grants for utilities conditional on shutoff moratoriums. The National Association of Clean Water Agencies expects the pandemic to cost $12.5bn in lost revenue due to unpaid bills, debt forgiveness and restoring service.
Last week, House speaker Nancy Pelosi signalled plans to propose $85bn for water projects in a subsequent forthcoming infrastructure bill to stimulate economic recovery.
Almost 28 million people could lose their jobs by May, according to forecasting firm Oxford Economics – more than double the jobs cut during the 2007 to 2009 recession and its aftermath.
Congresswoman Lawrence said: “Access to water has not been a priority in this country because it’s been a poor person’s issue ... now it’s a national concern and we have to transform our mindset.”

What is Covid-19 and what are the symptoms?
Covid-19 is the illness caused by a novel member of the coronavirus family that has transferred from animals to humans. The most common symptoms are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell.
About 80% of people experience a mild case and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people become seriously ill.

 How do I know if I have coronavirus and what happens next? – video explainer
How do I protect myself and others from the coronavirus?
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds each time, and use hand sanitiser gel. Catch coughs and sneezes with a disposable tissue and bin the tissue. If you don’t have a tissue available, cough and sneeze into the crook of your arm. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
How should I self-isolate if I am showing symptoms?
Different countries have set different rules, but broadly speaking, if you live alone and develop a new continuous cough or a high temperature it is recommended to stay at home for seven days after symptoms began. If you live with others, everyone in the house must stay at home and not leave for 14 days. Studies show that people have the coronavirus without symptoms for five days on average.
The infection may spread from person to person in shared houses. If anyone else starts to show symptoms while already in isolation, they must stay at home for seven days from the moment their own symptoms start, regardless of where they are in the 14-day isolation period. Check with your local medical authorities for specific advice that may be applied in your area.
What is social and physical distancing?
Many authorities are asking people to practise social and physical distancing. To reduce the spread of the virus, you should avoid meeting up with friends and family who don’t live with you. If you need to see the doctor or other essential services, use the phone, internet or social media if possible. In some places, you can go out for a walk for exercise and to buy essentials, but stay two metres apart from others. Check with local authorities for specific rules that may be applied in your area.
Tips for safer shopping
How do I care for someone suffering from Covid-19?
Keep the patient rested and comfortable in loose-fitting clothing, keep the room where they are well ventilated, and ensure they drink plenty of water. Over-the counter pain relief may be helpful – but paracetamol (Tylenol) is recommended rather than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen (Advil).
To prevent the coronavirus spreading within the household, if possible keep the patient in their own separate room and using a separate bathroom. They should have separate cutlery, crockery, bedding and towels, and preferably wear a mask. Regularly clean and disinfect high-frequency touch surfaces in the home such as door handles, toilets, kitchen counters and tabletops. Everybody in the house should be washing their hands frequently. 
Why are some people at greater risk from coronavirus?
People with diabetes or heart disease are known to be at greater risk from coronavirus. The over-70s and pregnant women are also considered to be at higher risk. Men also seem more likely to die than women.

Where has the coronavirus spread?
The coronavirus has spread to more than 150 countries. See the global map of confirmed cases or how many confirmed cases there are in your area in the UK or a map of the latest cases state by state in the US.
How many people have been affected globally?

What are countries doing to halt the spread of the coronavirus?
Many countries have imposed travel bans, closed schools and introduced curfews and lockdown conditions to try to halt the spread of the disease.
In the UK there is a set of lockdown conditions to limit the movement of people. Schools are closed except to the children of a defined government list of key workers. All non-essential travel is discouraged, and there are a list of government travel warnings about visiting the rest of the world.

 Coronavirus lockdown in the UK: the dos and don'ts – video explainer
Could I already have had this coronavirus?
There is no test to tell. Scientists are developing antibody tests to check for a prior infection, but those aren’t ready for clinical use. The only definitive way to know that you’ve had it is to test positive for it while you have it.
Find out more: Have I already had the coronavirus?
Can a mask protect me?
To some extent, yes, but not completely. Masks are effective at capturing droplets, a main transmission route of coronavirus. If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. However, masks will probably make little difference if you’re just walking around town, and are no guarantee of protection. Medical staff working with Covid-19 patients have been catching the virus despite all the protective equipment they have at their disposal.
How long does coronavirus live on different surfaces?
The New England Journal of Medicine published a study that tested how long the virus can remain stable on different kinds of surfaces within a controlled laboratory setting. They found that it was still detectable on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours. But it’s important to note that the amount of virus decreased rapidly over time on each of those surfaces. And so the risk of infection from touching them would probably decrease over time as well.

What do we know about Covid-19 and children?
Reassuringly for parents, the disease has generally been milder in children, though they can spread it without displaying any symptoms. There are many unknowns, and research is continuing.

How do I explain the coronavirus to my children?
With many children around the world suddenly taken out of school, it can be a worrying and bewildering time for them.

How does the coronavirus attack the human body?
The coronavirus is a strip of ribonucleic acid inside a spherical protein capsule that is covered in spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell’s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process. The spikes latch on to human cells about four times more strongly than those on the related Sars coronavirus. This suggests that coronavirus particles inhaled through the nose or mouth have a high chance of attaching to cells in the upper respiratory tract, meaning relatively few are needed for an infection to gain a foothold.

What happens to people’s lungs when they get coronavirus?
The cough and fever is a result of the infection reaching the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside. The lining of the air passages become injured, causing inflammation. The inflammation can spread throughout the lungs, causing them to fill with liquid, making breathing difficult. The lungs are then unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, which can cause death.

Where did the coronavirus originate?
The first recorded case of the coronavirus is believed to have emerged in November 2019 in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. Many of those first affected had worked in or visited the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the city of 11 million people.
Have there been other coronaviruses?
Yes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) were both caused by coronaviruses that made the leap from animals to humans. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750.
What is the mortality rate of the new coronavirus?
It is probably about or a bit less than 1%. The rate appears to be as high as 4% from globally confirmed case figures, but it is likely that many mild cases are going undetected. However a 1% mortality rate would still make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally. The death rate also increases significantly for people over 60.
Why is it a pandemic and what does that mean?
A pandemic is declared by WHO when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads in multiple countries simultaneously. Declaring a pandemic has nothing to do with changes to the characteristics of the disease or how dangerous it is.
Find out more: What is a pandemic?
When will there be a coronavirus vaccine?
Currently there is no cure or vaccine for the coronavirus. Human trials are under way – but even if they go well and a cure is found, there are many barriers before global immunisation is feasible. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be considered quick.
Find out more: When will a coronavirus vaccine will be ready?
How does coronavirus affect our pets?
There’s little evidence that domestic pets can catch the coronavirus, but contact between them and an infected person may help transmit the virus. It is recommended to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after coming into contact with any animal.

I have been dreading my first chemotherapy appointment.
I started radiation treatment a couple of days ago, and the 15-minute sessions (in which I lie on my back as a big machine rotates around me) didn’t bother me much. But the idea of having to sit passively as toxic drugs are slowly funneled into my body has kept me up at night.
The doctors told me that three days after the first treatment, the side effects will really start to hit me. A nurse told me about possible hearing loss. It’s a scary prospect as I pride myself on my bat-like hearing. She also asked whether I have a separate bathroom that my husband Eric and our two kids won’t use, because 24 hours after my first dose, my urine and sweat would start to become toxic.
At that moment, the enormity of my situation came barreling through the walls of the hospital and hit me. I’m trying to keep me and my family safe from a deadly virus, which means staying inside and away from sick people. But I’m also trying to keep myself from dying of cervical cancer, which requires not only going to a hospital almost every day, but pumping toxic drugs into my system that I then bring home with me.



'What a terrible time to have cancer': falling ill during the coronavirus crisis

The drive to the hospital for the appointment this morning took a fraction of the time it normally does. It was 9.15am and the roads were empty, except for a few drivers who seemed to have forgotten the meaning of a red light.
Since Washington’s stay-home mandate came into effect to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the streets of Bellevue have been reduced to dog walkers and a very busy pick-up line for grocery store orders.
My husband, Eric, dropped me off at the front of the hospital. I started feeling hot and sweaty, and I was breathing harder than normal.
Several security guards were stationed just inside the entrance. I was told to stand in line on a blue piece of tape that kept everyone six feet apart from one another. A pair of nurses wearing long hospital gowns, masks and gloves asked if I’d had diarrhea in the last 72 hours, had been coughing or having trouble breathing. Then they took my temperature.

As I walked over to the elevator, I noticed all of the side doors had been blocked off or were guarded by a hospital staff member. I used my sleeve to hit the elevator door, and relaxed a bit when no one else followed me inside such a confined space.
On the second floor, nurses led me to a large chair that reclines and even has buttons for a built-in massage and heating. They gave me pillows and a blanket, and there was some cheese and fruit set out.
I could see five other people getting treatment, but we were all spaced far apart from one another. I scrolled through Facebook and Twitter, watched some of the governor’s press conference and then put in my headphones to listen to the Hamilton soundtrack.
With my 15-year-old son’s asthma and Eric’s artificial heart valve, we agreed no one would come with me into the hospital for these appointments. It was not an easy decision. But to be completely honest, as scared as I have been, the prospect of getting a four-hour break from my family was actually pretty appealing.



The barrage of questions just wouldn’t stop: Did I wash everything off? Did I bring something home today?

We’ve been cooped up together in the house for the past two weeks, except for occasional walks, doctors’ appointments and grocery store order pick-ups. My son, Michael, has started having weekly online movie nights with his friends, and both he and my daughter, James, who has autism, have been drawing a lot. They’re really good artists. I’m not sure where they get it. I can’t even write my name the same way twice.
The doctors gave me anti-nausea medicine and steroids, so I felt a strange combination of tired and energized when I got home.
Last night, I had fallen asleep on my living room couch at 4am, a little earlier than my new normal these days. The barrage of unending questions just wouldn’t stop: Did I wash everything off from the hospital visits? Did I bring something home today? How many days do I have before I start to feel sick?
My doctor gave me a prescription for Xanax, so I hope that will help. I’ve never been on any type of anxiety medication before. But when we met in his office, with my chair set noticeably farther away from his desk, we both agreed that this was the right choice.
My dad died two days ago. It had nothing to do with coronavirus, but it was sudden. He lives in Idaho and we haven’t spoken in five years for a number of reasons, including the fact that I knew he wouldn’t be able to accept my kids after they came out as LGBTQ.
But I have been worried about how my three younger siblings are handling this, since they were close with him. One day after his death, Idaho’s governor announced a shelter-in-place order, which means they won’t be able to have a real funeral.
I’ve been in touch with my siblings a lot recently, to try and help them as they clean out dad’s house. It’s actually been nice because it makes me feel like I’m doing something.
I feel relieved that I no longer have to wonder about what will happen during chemo. I made it through the first appointment, so I know I can make it through the next four more.
I’m still terrified about what the next few days and weeks will bring, but hopefully getting over that hurdle will be enough to calm my worried brain, at least for one night.

Messages wishing Boris Johnson a speedy recovery have been pouring in from across the political divide amid calls for the prime minister to take a break from leading the country to allow full recovery from Covid-19.



Boris Johnson can run country from hospital bed, says UK minister

Donald Trump also passed on his nation’s best wishes to the UK leader, who was admitted to hospital on Sunday with continuing Covid-19 symptoms. 
The US president told his daily coronavirus press conference: “All Americans are praying for him.”
He added: “He’s a great friend of mine. I’m sure he is going to be fine. He’s a strong man, a strong person.”
Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, and his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, both wished Johnson a speedy recovery while the former prime minister Tony Blair, who was hospitalised himself briefly in 2003 to correct an abnormal heart rhythm during his premiership, said Johnson’s hospital situation must be “hellish”.
Blair told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I have every sympathy and solidarity with him. I know it must be a hellish situation to be in.”
There were also messages of support from the Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran and the Labour backbencher David Lammy, one of Johnson’s fiercest critics, who said: “The whole country wants you to return to full health as soon as possible.”

There were also calls for Johnson to reflect on his health and take time out from Downing Street if necessary rather than soldier on.
The former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake said it would be “sensible” for Boris Johnson to “step back” if he was not well enough to carry out his role for now.
He told the Today programme: “I think in the end if he’s not well, he will have to reflect on this because the job’s tough at the best of times and it’s doubly tough now.”
Michael Gove’s wife, the Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, suggested Johnson’s failure to shake off the virus was linked to his commitment to continue leading the nation’s battle against the virus. “Boris has worked non-stop throughout his illness – and now we see the result,” she tweeted.

Asked whether Johnson should hand over control during his illness, Blair said: “I’m not going to second guess them on that.
“He knows the state of his own condition and he will be judging it carefully himself, I’m sure.”
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the prime minister’s admission to hospital had been a precautionary move taken “on the advice of his doctor” because he had continued to have “persistent symptoms” 10 days after testing positive for the virus.
Johnson tested positive last month along with Matt Hancock, who has recovered. His chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, also self-isolated.
Johnson’s pregnant 32-year-old fiancee, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday she was feeling better.

From an apartment above 11 Downing Street, and with food brought to his door, Johnson continued to lead the government’s response and chaired meetings via video conference.
He has posted a series of video messages since then, initially appearing in a suit and tie, but in the latest post on Friday he appeared weary, sitting in a chair with his shirt open at the neck.
“Although I’m feeling better and I’ve done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,” he said.
The pound briefly fell 0.4% against the US dollar to $1.2215 on the news before trimming some losses to trade at $1.2230, down 0.3%.

"94","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/japan-poised-to-declare-state-of-emergency-over-coronavirus","2020-04-06T06:37:43-0400","  Japan poised to declare state of emergency over coronavirus ","
Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is poised to declare a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures as early as Tuesday in an attempt to stem a sharp rise in coronavirus cases in the capital and other major cities.
The measure, to go into effect for about a month, will enable local authorities to urge people to stay at home except to shop for food, seek medical care, go to work if necessary, and take daily exercise.
“We hope to declare a state of emergency as early as tomorrow after listening to the opinions of the advisory panel,” Abe told reporters on Monday evening.
“We are seeing rapid increases of new infections, particularly in urban areas such as Tokyo and Osaka.
“Considering that medical institutions are facing a critical situation, I have received opinions that the government should prepare to declare a state of emergency.”
Abe’s apparent reluctance to implement tougher measures earlier in the crisis had drawn criticism from the Japan Medical Association and Yuriko Koike, the governor of Tokyo, where confirmed cases have surged in the past week.
Japan has avoided the large number of Covid-19 cases and deaths that have prompted lockdowns in other countries, but there is growing alarm over the rise in infections in the capital, particularly among young people.
Tokyo reported a record 148 new cases on Sunday, with a further 83 on Monday taking its total to over 1,000, according to the public broadcaster NHK. The majority of confirmed cases over the weekend involved people aged below 50, with many in their 20s and 30s.
More than 3,500 people have tested positive and 85 have died from the virus in Japan, NHK said. While the figures are low compared to the US, China and parts of Europe, officials are concerned that a surge in infections could place intolerable strain on the country’s hospitals.
The declaration will allow the governors of Japan’s 47 prefectures to call on people to stay at home and businesses to close, but they will not have the legal authority to impose the kind of lockdowns seen in other countries, or to fine residents who ignore the request.
“If you ask me if we can enforce a lockdown like France, the answer is no,” Abe told MPs last week.
He is also expected to unveil “unprecedented” stimulus measures in response to the “biggest crisis” the global economy has faced since the second world war, according to a draft document.
The 108 trillion yen (£800bn) package, which has yet to be finalised, would be much bigger than the country’s response in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis.

Koike has voiced concern over the high number of untraced cases and growing pressure on the city’s hospitals, and supports a “soft” lockdown to protect the city’s 14 million residents.
Legal revisions passed last month gave Abe scope to declare a state of emergency if the coronavirus outbreak posed a “grave danger” to public health and threatened serious damage to the world’s third-biggest economy, which is now on the brink of recession.
Officials are hoping peer pressure will encourage people to stay at home and to practise social distancing when they go out. Businesses that refuse to cooperate face being publicly named and shamed.
In addition, local leaders will be able to requisition facilities to use as temporary medical centres and order the closure of schools and other gathering places such as theatres, music venues and stadiums. Most of the country’s schools have been closed for more than a month following a request by Abe.
His declaration is initially expected to target the greater Tokyo metropolitan area – with a population of more than 36 million – along with Osaka and five other areas.
Under the declaration, hospitals will be able to transfer people with mild symptoms to specially designated hotels to free up medical facilities for more serious cases, local media reported.
Abe has faced accusations that he and other officials started seriously addressing the outbreak only after it became inevitable that the Olympics, initially due to be held in Tokyo this summer, would have to be postponed.
Schools and many other public facilities have been closed for a month, and some companies are allowing employees to work from home, but calls to avoid socialising at bars and restaurants have failed to resonate.
Citing evidence of infection clusters in entertainment districts, Koike has urged residents to stay at home for the past two weekends and to avoid crowded places until 12 April.
The message appeared to have got through this weekend, with several restaurant chains and shops, along with the capital’s ubiquitous pachinko and karaoke parlours, closing their doors. Rail and subway operators are also reporting dramatic falls in passenger numbers.

In the autumn of 1962, the celebrated Iranian poet Forough Farrokhzad made what would be her first and last film. Regarded as a precursor to the Iranian new wave and now considered a classic, The House Is Black is a documentary about the members of a leper colony near the city of Tabriz in northwest Iran. Despite having been filmed nearly 60 years ago, and focusing on a small group of people suffering from a particular condition, it has found new relevance in the age of the coronavirus pandemic, having much to say not only about the current situation in Iran but also to those in self-isolation and/or suffering, regardless of location.
Farrokhzad’s short film is anything but an easy watch. Ebrahim Golestan, its producer (who was in a secret relationship with Farrokhzad at the time) states this explicitly at the start. “On this screen,” he says, “will appear an image of ugliness, a vision of pain no caring human being should ignore.” This echoes the sentiments of the poet Sa’di of Shiraz, who in the 13th century famously declared: “You who are indifferent to the misery of others cannot be called a human being.”

Watch a trailer for The House Is Black
Golestan’s “ugliness”, however, turns out to be something of a euphemism. While some of Farrokhzad’s subjects are being treated for leprosy at an early stage, others haven’t been as fortunate. In the first scene, a girl regards what is exposed of her mutilated face in a mirror. Elsewhere a blind, noseless man handles a cigarette with mere stubs for fingers. Farrokhzad does not, however, treat any of them as anomalies or grotesques but as people; and her empathy is accentuated by her passionate readings of her poetry. “Let us listen to the soul,” she says, “who sings in the remote desert, the one who sighs and stretches his hands out, saying, ‘Alas, my wounds have numbed my spirit.’”
In his preface, Golestan says that the motive and hope of the film is “to wipe out this ugliness and relieve the victims”; but The House Is Black is a little more complex than that. According to Nasrin Rahimieh, professor of comparative literature at the University of California, Farrokhzad told Bernardo Bertolucci that “she saw the leper colony as an example or a model of a world imprisoned by its illnesses, difficulties, and poverty”. Rahimieh suggests that “life in the leper colony is a metaphor for life in general”. Hamid Dabashi, professor of Iranian studies and comparative literature at Columbia University, and Roxanne Varzi, a professor of anthropology and film at the University of California, suggest, respectively, that the film reflects the “brutalised history” of Iran, and serves as a metaphor for “the Shah’s oppressive social policies and a critique of the practice of religion at the time”.

 Forough Farrokhzad during the making of The House Is Black
The House Is Black has taken on even more meaning in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. For one, it can make those self-isolating appreciate what they have. Our pandemic will pass, but for the quarantined patients in the film, especially those with advanced leprosy, illness and isolation from the rest of society are facts of life. They have no recovery to look forward to, passing out their days in a slow decay. “I am poured out like water … as those who have long been dead,” Farrokhzad says in her voiceover. “On my eyelids is the shadow of death.”
That said, there is some light in the film: children giggle at school and while playing football, dealing with the situation as best they can, while other patients are shown making merry at a wedding. The film’s contrasting of scenes in a hospital in which Golestan discusses the treatment of leprosy, with those of fatalistic worshippers submitting to the will of God in a mosque, says volumes about the conflicting attitudes of and towards science and religion in Iran.
On that note, the “house” in the film (ie, the colony) can certainly stand as a metaphor for coronavirus-era Iran: a pariah nation battling a pandemic under crippling US sanctions costing ordinary Iranians their lives at an alarming rate. In perhaps the film’s most harrowing scene, a schoolboy is asked to write a sentence on the blackboard with the word “house”. He thinks to himself before scrawling with his damaged fingers: “The house is black.”

 Coronavirus is draining America's public infrastructure. A federal jobs policy would protect its workers ","
Last week, more than six million people applied for unemployment, the largest jump in unemployment claims in our country’s history. The Federal Reserve estimates that the Covid-19 pandemic could lead to 47 million Americans losing their jobs in the weeks to come. With little hope of being re-hired, these workers will struggle to stay healthy, feed their children, and pay rent on the meager, one-time $1,200 check authorized by the most recent federal stimulus package.
At the same time, we face the consequences of starving our public infrastructure. Our cities are deficient in resources and underprepared for a pandemic epidemiologists have been warning government officials would be coming. Despite claims that ours is the best healthcare system in the world, our hospitals and nursing homes do not have sufficient masks, gloves, protective gear, flu tests, ventilators, hand sanitizer, or disinfectant wipes to protect either their own staff or their patients. We need workers to produce these essential products.
We know that millions of workers right now need jobs. We need to put Americans to work in good, well-paying jobs making the supplies and providing the services that we need as a nation to thrive. Radically expanding federal employment to put these displaced workers to work is in the interest of our national security.
If a federal jobs guarantee policy were enacted, the federal government would be empowered to provide both a living wage and health insurance to the recently unemployed. They would be put back to work manufacturing the supplies our nation’s healthcare workers desperately need and providing the essential services necessary to keep our nation’s schoolchildren, elderly and vulnerable fed and cared for during this frightening time. These jobs would pay a living wage of at least $15 an hour and include healthcare benefits. Instead of bailing out the stock market, our federal government could instead organize a civic labor force working for the health and security of American families through this continuing pandemic.
There is clear historical precedent for this type of response during a crisis. During the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt introduced the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which provided jobs for workers who needed them aimed at strengthening the public infrastructure and building prosperity for the next generation of American children.
Dramatically expanding AmeriCorps, an existing federal program which already employs thousands of workers in various civic improvement projects, would put more people to work in service to their communities. What would these federally-employed workers get paid to do? The United States might follow the example of other developed nations in nationalizing essential manufacturing. This was exactly the purpose and scope of the Defense Production Act. No factory capable of producing masks, protective gear, hand sanitizer, or ventilators should be standing idle through a healthcare crisis. Failing to use these resources for the benefit of the greater good during a deadly pandemic is unacceptable.



No factory should be standing idle through a healthcare crisis. Failing to use these resources during a deadly pandemic is unacceptable

Medical supplies are not the only things America needs to survive this pandemic. According to CNN, while some food banks are shutting down, others are reporting that demand has quadrupled. Food pantries are unable to keep up with demand, as laid-off workers seek food assistance and volunteers are stuck at home. Right now, the National Guard is employed in this essential work of feeding those who cannot feed themselves. Given that summer is coming, and with it forest fires and hurricanes, it is only a matter of time before we will need them elsewhere. Preparing and delivering meals safely is obviously a critical mission for our federal government during a pandemic, and the administration should be making plans to employ civilian workers to perform this essential labor.
In the absence of a larger government response that genuinely recognizes the unprecedented precarity of the typical American wage earner, families are turning to GoFundMe. Hundreds and hundreds of pages in the last two weeks have been set up to help neighborhoods provide food to the vulnerable, to donate money to laid off restaurant workers, and pay for health-related costs. In no way is this a sustainable or ethical safety net in the richest nation on earth.
In these times of great inequality, where millions of American workers face an uncertain employment future, a federal jobs guarantee program could turn the page on a dark chapter of our nation’s history. New York and Texas have both enlisted the incarcerated to make hand sanitizer, as prison labor is cheap and the incarcerated have little recourse. Meanwhile, those in dire need of income are working without protective equipment or health insurance to provide food delivery to those who are able to self-quarantine and work from home.
While some may suggest employing people during a pandemic might put them at risk, it is clear that “essential” workers are already doing these jobs for lower pay, no benefits, and with insufficient protective equipment. Providing this option, alongside robust unemployment benefits and other essential labor protections, will make both workers and our society safer.
Without a federal effort to provide economic security and health insurance to those who need it, the most vulnerable Americans will continue to put their lives at risk, exacerbating inequality and making recovery even harder. As Donald Trump weighs a job program as part of a larger investment in infrastructure, a federal jobs guarantee must be an essential part of the package.

Britain’s new car registrations plummeted by 44% in March, a steeper fall than during the financial crisis, as the coronavirus crisis led to showroom closures and sent sales tumbling.
Sales in March were 203,000 down on the same month a year earlier, according to data released by the industry body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
March is traditionally one of the strongest months of the year for new car sales because of the release of new number plates. However, this was the weakest March since the late 90s, when the twice-yearly number plate change was introduced.
Britain’s car industry was already struggling before the pandemic – hit by a combination of falling sales, a shift away from diesel vehicles and Brexit uncertainty.

The figures are a stark indication of what happens when economies grind to a halt, said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT.
“How long the market remains stalled is uncertain but it will reopen and the products will be there. In the meantime, we will continue to work with government to do all we can to ensure the thousands of people employed in this sector are ready for work,” he said.
Dramatic falls in new car sales have been reported in other European countries that introduced lockdowns earlier than Britain, including Italy, where sales fell 85% in March, France, down 72%, and Spain, which was 69% lower.
The second quarter will be the most difficult for the auto industry, according to the investment bank JP Morgan, which has downgraded its global car production forecast for Europe, the Americas and China from 9% to a 19% fall compared with 2019.
Forecasts suggest the continued closure of car plants across Europe and North America will cost the auto industry more than $100bn (£82bn) in lost revenues if the shutdown lasts until the end of April.
All major European carmakers have suspended production because of disruption caused by the spread of the coronavirus and if this continues as expected until the end of April, this will account for €66bn (£58bn) in lost sales in Europe, or 2.6m cars. In North America it would lead to lost sales of about $52bn (£42bn), or 2m cars.
The calculations have been made by Ian Henry, the owner of the consultancy AutoAnalysis, who produces forecasts for the SMMT, along with the automotive team at consultancy GlobalData.
Assembly lines ground to a halt in March as the lockdown across Europe disrupted global supply chains, and analysts predicted large falls in demand in all key markets.

All volume manufacturers from BMW to Toyota and Nissan to Jaguar Land Rover sent their workers home after the worsening outbreak on the continent led companies to examine the health implications for their workers.
The story was repeated across North America as the Detroit carmakers, including General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, shut down their plants.
Auto firms initially closed their sites for a number of weeks, saying they would keep the situation under review, but the shutdown is anticipated to last longer than first expected.
Henry predicts that each additional week of plant closures in Europe will cost the industry an extra €8bn (£7bn) in lost production value and similarly $7.5bn (£6bn) in North America.
International supply chains complicate the question of when car plants can reopen, Henry said, while it is also difficult to predict when consumers will starting buying cars again.
“What will be the state of consumer demand after this?” Henry said. “Will the man in the street want to buy a new car? A huge proportion of cars go to companies and fleet managers won’t be looking to buy cars for executives.”

On the cracked country roads of Lexington, deep in the Mississippi delta, an empty yellow school bus drives slowly, making life-sustaining drop offs on the way.
Here, in the poorest county, in America’s poorest state, the coronavirus has yet to ravage the jurisdiction with infection. There has been one recorded Covid-19 death in the county, Clinton Cobbins, Lexington’s first African American mayor. But even now the coronavirus still poses a serious threat to life.
In Holmes county consolidated – the school district to which Lexington belongs – every single child qualifies for free school meals, a marker of pervasive poverty. For many, said superintendent Dr James L Henderson, breakfast and lunch at school are the only nutritious meals a student will eat in a day. For a few, they are the only meals.
When the coronavirus pandemic led to statewide school closures, Henderson, who was born in the county, left for most of his adult life, but returned in 2018 to assume his position, was left with a significant dilemma: how to feed the 3,000 children under his authority.

Many children in this rural district come from households too poor to afford a car. So the superintendent embarked on an improvised project, driving 6,000 meals a day out across the county in a small fleet of 70 school buses, dropping each packet off at a stop along the route.
“We absolutely see this as a matter of life and death,” he said. “We have to do it on behalf of our children. It’s just that simple. Families are suffering here.”
“If there is a silver lining to Covid-19, even in the poorest county in the poorest state, we genuinely care about each other. We are working to that end to make sure we’re providing for all children.
The novel strategy underlines the escalating crisis the coronavirus has imposed on Mississippi, America’s most food insecure state. In Holmes county 35% of residents are already food insecure, according to recent research and that number is certain to rise substantially as the coronavirus pandemic takes hold.
As the yellow school bus pulled into one driveway, nine-year-old Keizarrian Thomas dashed from his porch and collected three lunch packages – two for his brothers. A juice box, three celery sticks and a ham sandwich in each.
‘This is getting so much harder’

His mother, Felichia Walden, had just been furloughed from her job at a local car company because of the virus.
“With the money that we do have we’ve got to try and pay the bills,” she said. “And when you go to the grocery store you can hardly get things.”
At the next stop, a few hundred feet down the street, Arletha Gaston took four meals for her children who sat on the stoop of their trailer home, playing tag in the morning sun.
Quick guide How you can help food banks in the Covid-19 pandemic  
 Show 
 Hide  


How to help

Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs. 
As this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help.



Donate money or supplies

The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families.
If you want to help, find your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund.



Volunteers

Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use Feeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice.



Social media

Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.

“This is getting so much harder,” she said. “We’re trying to get out of town to look for better deals on food.”
Holmes county, with a population of 18,000 people, has only two fresh grocery stores and both face allegations of price gouging during the pandemic.
Zelpha Whatley, who hosts a weekly local call in radio show, said countless listeners, many of whom receive food stamps to purchase their basic groceries, had complained on her show about rising prices – in some instances tripling or quadrupling the price.
“I couldn’t believe these two stores would take advantage of the situation,” she said. “So I went to one to check myself. When I saw the price of eggs had doubled, I walked out and said ‘I’m not paying’. My brain just melted because I was so upset.”

In a brief phone interview the owner of Lexington’s only grocery store, Roy Sims, denied he had inflated prices for profit, arguing produce, including eggs, dairy and meat, had risen at wholesale. Sims declined to cite specific margins.
“If people have a problem they should report it to the Attorney General of Mississippi,” he said. “We’re not talking to anyone else about price gouging.”
Mississippi may still be at the early stage of the pandemic compared to other hotspots in the US – particularly neighbouring Louisiana. Thirty-five people have died of Covid-19 here with 1,455 cases statewide. But the state already has the highest rate of hospitalizations due to coronavirus, according to analysis by Mississippi Today.
As the school bus food drop offs concluded their lunchtime run last Wednesday, Republican governor Tate Reeves announced a state-wide shelter in place order, after days of criticism his administration had been too slow to act.
“I pray that all of our orders and preparations will be enough. We believe that this is the right tool at the right time to save lives,” Reeves said.
But the virus has already amplified food insecurity across Mississippi, not just in Holmes county.

“Hunger is rampant here,” said Charles Beadie, CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, the only in-state foodbank that distributes to 415 agencies. “600,000 were already going to bed hungry or not knowing how they will get their meal.”
The network is under major pressure in the first few weeks of the crisis. A number of agencies have closed down due to volunteers being afraid of infection. At least one county in the state now has no access to food bank resources. The network is chronically understaffed and free labor from the state’s prison network is no longer available due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, demand has surged.
“We have more phone calls than we can handle,” Beadie said, acknowledging his organization was struggling to quantify the increased scale of demand.
‘It’s like a scavenger hunt’
In Jackson, the state’s capital city, volunteers have begun running hot meal services to some of the city’s poorest neighbourhoods.
Like Holmes county and dozens of other districts in the state, every child in Jackson qualifies for free school meals. And while the school district continues to offer a pick up meal service there are no drop offs here.

April Jackson, a 30-year-old mother of seven, has no car and said she had been unable to pick up meals for her children provided by the school.
Volunteers from the Poor People’s Campaign, and Operation Good – a local collective of activists – have been organizing hot food drop offs at this low income apartment complex, for the past week.
“It’s like a scavenger hunt,” Jackson said as residents queued for handouts. “People are going crazy and everyone is on the hunt for food.”
She lost her part-time job this week at a school cafeteria and is now completely reliant on handouts and food stamps to feed her family. She received $278 in weekly food benefits before the crisis and had expected more after the state announced an increase in emergency benefits to families. She said she got just $6 more.
“I just took it,” she said. “I bought a block of cheese. That was it.”

"100","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/1980s-aids-pandemic-coronavirus-gay-community-survive","2020-04-06T05:53:53-0400","  
 Fear, bigotry and misinformation – this reminds me of the 1980s Aids pandemic ","
I am a gay man who lived through the Aids pandemic, so many people have asked me to compare that crisis with the one we now face. The main difference between the two is that Aids at first appeared to afflict specific populations, while coronavirus is an equal opportunity malady. I remember when I visited Paris in 1981 I told Michel Foucault, the French philosopher, about Aids and he laughed at this American invention that seemed to target both gay men and Haitians. He said: “That’s too perfect, blacks and gays, only American racists and puritans would have come up with that delusion.” He died from the disease in 1984.
In the mid-80s, I wrote an article in which I said American gays, at least younger ones, had worked through their self-hatred in the post-Stonewall 70s but that internalised homophobia had come back with the Aids stigma in the 1980s. We knew we were a hated community; relatives wouldn’t let us hold their babies. Eventually the viral nature of the disease became known and we discovered the only two significant modes of transmission were blood and semen, but in the early days people feared physical contact, mosquitoes, kisses, coughs. Actually, coronavirus is much more easily communicated than Aids ever was.



Coronavirus symptoms: what are they and should I call the doctor?

I was the first president and one of the six founders of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis in 1981; we felt we were so isolated, so alone, in our struggle that we could only imagine giving a disco fundraiser for gay men. When later I observed Foucault’s widower, Daniel Defert, in 1985 start the charity Aides, I was impressed that he went immediately to the French health minister; American gays had such low self-esteem they (we) didn’t think we had the right to societal concern.
Aids bore a badge of shame even in the gay community – if you were infected it was your own fault for not practising safe sex – whereas everyone feels sympathy for coronavirus victims. Whereas Aids was a death sentence for almost all who were afflicted, most people with coronavirus show only mild symptoms and even those who are hospitalised mostly recover. Whereas doctors and nurses did not get Aids from working with patients (except for a few unfortunate healthcare and lab workers who accidentally were contaminated with infected blood) health workers are highly vulnerable to coronavirus, and shortages of protective equipment only increase this vulnerability.
Coronavirus is the first pandemic of the social media era, and misinformation, conspiracy theories and racist slurs flood various public sites. Have you heard the one that Boris Johnson invented the infection in order to win back public sympathy? Such scandals were also perpetrated by hearsay in the Aids era, but social media has amplified them.
While the rumour mill might be taking the same approach, official pronouncements from the White House take a different tack. Ronald Reagan only mentioned Aids once, whereas Donald Trump has turned his daily televised briefings into self-congratulatory rallies. Which is worse? Presidential indifference or the politicisation of the bully-pulpit (not to mention Trumpian rumours)? Remember when Trump said there were just a few cases in America and those were being cured, that the virus would vanish miraculously? Or remember when he wouldn’t let the sick passengers disembark from a cruise ship because that would augment “his” numbers? Just as Aids was first dubbed Gay-Related Immune Deficiency (Grid), the president has worked hard to dub this virus the “Chinese virus”.
Both pandemics have had their folklore “origin” stories. Randy Shilts in his 1987 book And the Band Played On later claimed he was forced by his publisher to pin the American spread of Aids on “patient zero”, a handsome Canadian flight attendant, just as the American plague is being traced back to a mythical Wuhan businessman. At least most educated people don’t try to locate the person who “gave” them coronavirus, whereas many Aids patients sought to blame a particular sex partner. Now the contacts are ubiquitous and might be your granddaughter or nephew or your murderous teen who’s still playing basketball or enjoying spring break in Florida.
Ironically, the same doctor, Anthony Fauci, was the “villain” of the Aids epidemic (the activist group Act-Up accused him of not releasing life-saving drugs) and is the hero of coronavirus (the voice of scientific reason in the Trump administration). In both epidemics he has insisted on running studies of new drugs. In the crazy Trumpian far right he has been accused of undermining the president’s looniest pronouncements.



Trump's narcissism has taken a new twist. And now he has American blood on his hands | Jonathan Freedland

Aids victims could be all ages and all physical conditions, and they often took years to die, meanwhile parading their skeletal bodies or Kaposi’s sarcoma stigmata. Whereas the characterisation of people who die of coronavirus is of those already old and sick from underlying conditions, the stereotypical Aids patient started out as a buff 30-year-old weightlifter. But cynics would say the coronavirus patient has already outlived his or her sell-by date (this callousness strikes me, as an 80-year-old). A French aristocrat spoke delicately of Talleyrand’s cruel indifference to the tragedy of his émigré intimates by calling it his “too great sense of resignation when it came to the unhappiness of his friends”.
Whereas Elizabeth Taylor’s compassion and Aids fundraising, for instance, seemed remarkable, New York governor Andrew Cuomo’s intelligent take-charge attitude sets the civilised norm. In any event, by embracing the coronavirus cause, he runs no risk to his reputation.
Aids was surrounded from the beginning by moral opprobrium in America, especially because the disease was linked with perversion and sexual excess; coronavirus is already associated with maskless renegades who don’t keep their social distance.
Whereas I became positive for Aids in 1985, I survived because I was a “slow progressor” and my T-cell count fell very, very gradually. Now I’m going into my third week of coronavirus quarantine – I wonder if I’ll survive this one.
